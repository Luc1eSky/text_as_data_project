summary: Rowe has been writing all of her adult life- even through years of constant rejection from publishing houses. Between her tenacity and the encouragement of her family, her breakthrough finally came-- at the age of eighty! Here she shares her journey of attending myriad writers' conferences and honing her ability to see humor in everyday situations. Along the way Rowe delivers a hilarious array of stories that reflect her addiction to making people laugh. Even in her cancer support group, she manages to use her humor to affect others for the good. -- adapted from jacket
