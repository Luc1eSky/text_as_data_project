summary: Stein examines Los Angeles-- and a mythic cast of fortune hunters and aspiring moguls whose quests for fame and power destroyed many along the way. She tells the stories of five larger-than-life individuals and their families, each one representing different aspects of Los Angeles and the American dream. Each chapter paints a panoramic picture of outsiders pinning their hopes on Los Angeles-- then watching as the shadow of those dreams envelopes their loved ones, especially their children, and the city itself.
