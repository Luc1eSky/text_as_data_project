summary: The travel writer Paul Theroux turns his unflinching eye on an American South too often overlooked. He finds there a paradoxical place, full of incomparable music, unparalleled cuisine, and yet also some of the nation's worst schools, housing, and unemployment rates. On road trips spanning four seasons, wending along rural highways, Theroux visits gun shows and small-town churches, laborers in Arkansas, and parts of Mississippi where they still call the farm up the road 'the plantation.' He talks to mayors and social workers, writers and reverends, the working poor and farming families ... the unsung heroes of the south, the people who, despite it all, never left, and also those who returned home to rebuild a place they could never live without
