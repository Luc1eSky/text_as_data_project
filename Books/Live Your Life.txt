summary: In March 2020, Tony Award nominee Nick Cordero was hospitalized for what he and his wife, Amanda Kloots, believed to be a severe case of pneumonia. An eventual diagnosis of COVID-19 led to Nick's being placed on a ventilator, and Amanda took to documenting their journey on social media, showing the dangers COVID-19 posed to everyone, regardless of age. When he passed away after ninety-five grueling days in the ICU, the world grieved. Here Kloots tells the story of their life together; of Nick's fight for survival, and of their interrupted future as a family. She shows how friends, family, and even total strangers played a vital role in enduring this hardship. A reminder that, sometimes, celebrating life today is the only path through tomorrow's darkness. -- adapted from jacket
