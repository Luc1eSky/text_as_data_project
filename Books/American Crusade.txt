summary: Fox & Friends Weekend co-host Pete Hegseth says that America is at a flashpoint-and only a political and cultural Crusade will save our freedoms. In AMERICAN CRUSADE, Pete Hegseth explores whether the election of President Donald J. Trump was sign of a national rebirth, or instead the final act of a nation that has surrendered to Leftists who demand socialism, globalism, secularism, and politically-correct elitism. Can real America still win? And how? Hegseth is an old-school patriot who is on a mission to do his part to save our Republic. This book celebrates all that America stands for, while motivating and mustering fellow patriots to stand ready to defend-and save-our great country. As he travels around the country talking to American citizens from all walks of life, Hegseth reveals the common wisdom of average Americans-and how ready they are to join the cultural battlefield. Now is that time, and Hegseth has written the playbook. AMERICAN CRUSADE is written with the same insight, candor, political-incorrectness, and humor that has made his television show one of the most highly-rated in America.
