summary: Drawing on more than a hundred original interviews with family, friends, and colleagues, as well as extensive archival research, this biography offers a fresh and original look at the life and career of Robin Williams. New York Times culture reporter Dave Itzkoff explores how comic brilliance masked a deep well of conflicting emotions and self-doubt. Itzkoff also shows how Williams struggled mightily with addiction and depression, and with a debilitating condition at the end of his life that affected him in ways his fans never knew.
