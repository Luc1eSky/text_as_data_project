summary: A merciless probing of America's biggest cultural force - pro football - at a moment of peak success and high anxiety. Big Game is a journey through an epic storm of corruption and influence - the Deflategate scandal that rocked Leibovich s team, the New England Patriots and star quarterback Tom Brady. Ultimately, this is a chronicle of what may come to be seen as 'peak football' - the high point of the sport's economic success and cultural dominance, but also the moment when it all began to turn.
