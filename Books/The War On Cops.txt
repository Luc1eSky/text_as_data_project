summary: "This book expands on Mac Donald's ... reporting on 'the Ferguson effect' and the criminal-justice system. It deconstructs the central narrative of the Black Lives Matter movement: [in Mac Donald's view, it isn't] racist cops [that] are the greatest threat to young black males. On the contrary, it is criminals and gangbangers who are responsible for the high black homicide death rate"--Amazon.com.
