After oil was discovered beneath their land, the Osage rode in chauffeured automobiles, built mansions, and sent their children to study in Europe. Then, one by one, the Osage began to be killed off. The family of an Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, became a prime target. One of her relatives was shot. Another was poisoned. And it was just the beginning, as more and more Osage were dying under mysterious circumstances, and many of those who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered. As the death toll rose, the newly created FBI took up the case, and the young director, J. Edgar Hoover, turned to a former Texas Ranger named Tom White to try to unravel the mystery. White put together an undercover team, including a Native American agent who infiltrated the region, and together with the Osage began to expose one of the most chilling conspiracies in American history.

Levitt, New York Times bestselling author of Freakonomics Wouldn\u2019t you like to live longer? And better? In this operating manual for longevity, Dr. Peter Attia draws on the latest science to deliver innovative nutritional interventions, techniques for optimizing exercise and sleep, and tools for addressing emotional and mental health. For all its successes, mainstream medicine has failed to make much progress against the diseases of aging that kill most people: heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and type 2 diabetes. Too often, it intervenes with treatments too late to help, prolonging lifespan at the expense of healthspan, or quality of life. Dr. Attia believes we must replace this outdated framework with a personalized, proactive strategy for longevity, one where we take action now, rather than waiting. This is not \u201cbiohacking,\u201d it\u2019s science: a well-founded strategic and tactical approach to extending lifespan while also improving our physical, cognitive, and emotional health. Dr. Attia\u2019s aim is less to tell you what to do and more to help you learn how to think about long-term health, in order to create the best plan for you as an individual. In Outlive, readers will discover: \u2022 Why the cholesterol test at your annual physical doesn\u2019t tell you enough about your actual risk of dying from a heart attack. \u2022 That you may already suffer from an extremely common yet underdiagnosed liver condition that could be a precursor to the chronic diseases of aging. \u2022 Why exercise is the most potent pro-longevity \u201cdrug\u201d\u2014and how to begin training for the \u201cCentenarian Decathlon.\u201d \u2022 Why you should forget about diets, and focus instead on nutritional biochemistry, using technology and data to personalize your eating pattern. \u2022 Why striving for physical health and longevity, but ignoring emotional health, could be the ultimate curse of all. Aging and longevity are far more malleable than we think; our fate is not set in stone. With the right roadmap, you can plot a different path for your life, one that lets you outlive your genes to make each decade better than the one before."}, {"rank": 5, "rank_last_week": 5, "weeks_on_list": 14, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0385534264", "primary_isbn13": "9780385534260", "publisher": "Doubleday", "description": "The survivors of a shipwrecked British vessel on a secret mission during an imperial war with Spain have different accounts of events.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Wager", "author": "David Grann", "contributor": "by David Grann", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780385534260.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385534264?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0385534264", "isbn13": "9780385534260"}, {"isbn10": "0385534272", "isbn13": "9780385534277"}, {"isbn10": "0307747492", "isbn13": "9780307747495"}, {"isbn10": "0307747484", "isbn13": "9780307747488"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385534264?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780385534260?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780385534260"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BWAGER%2FDavid%2BGrann%2F9780385534260"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780385534260"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780385534260?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/92ec85ca-4cff-59b6-94a3-b81002bfc8e6", "list_date": "2023/08/06", "published_data": "2023-04-18", "summary": "From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Killers of the Flower Moon, a page-turning story of shipwreck, survival, and savagery, culminating in a court martial that reveals a shocking truth. With the twists and turns of a thriller Grann unearths the deeper meaning of the events on the Wager, showing that it was not only the captain and crew who ended up on trial, but the very idea of empire. On January 28, 1742, a ramshackle vessel of patched-together wood and cloth washed up on the coast of Brazil. Inside were thirty emaciated men, barely alive, and they had an extraordinary tale to tell. They were survivors of His Majesty\u2019s Ship the Wager, a British vessel that had left England in 1740 on a secret mission during an imperial war with Spain. While the Wager had been chasing a Spanish treasure-filled galleon known as \u201cthe prize of all the oceans,\u201d it had wrecked on a desolate island off the coast of Patagonia. The men, after being marooned for months and facing starvation, built the flimsy craft and sailed for more than a hundred days, traversing 2500 miles of storm-wracked seas. They were greeted as heroes. But then ... six months later, another, even more decrepit craft landed on the coast of Chile. This boat contained just three castaways, and they told a very different story. The thirty sailors who landed in Brazil were not heroes \u2013 they were mutineers. The first group responded with countercharges of their own, of a tyrannical and murderous senior officer and his henchmen. It became clear that while stranded on the island the crew had fallen into anarchy, with warring factions fighting for dominion over the barren wilderness. As accusations of treachery and murder flew, the Admiralty convened a court martial to determine who was telling the truth. The stakes were life-and-death\u2014for whomever the court found guilty could hang. The Wager is a grand tale of human behavior at the extremes told by one of our greatest nonfiction writers. Grann\u2019s recreation of the hidden world on a British warship rivals the work of Patrick O\u2019Brian, his portrayal of the castaways\u2019 desperate straits stands up to the classics of survival writing such as The Endurance, and his account of the court martial has the savvy of a Scott Turow thriller. As always with Grann\u2019s work, the incredible twists of the narrative hold the reader spellbound."}, {"rank": 6, "rank_last_week": 1, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0,

in this startling and hopeful prophecy for how our present era of civil unrest will resolve over the next ten years\u2014and what our lives will look like once it has. Twenty-five years ago, Neil Howe and the late William Strauss dazzled the world with a provocative new theory of American history. Looking back at the last 500 years, they\u2019d uncovered a distinct pattern: modern history moves in cycles, each one lasting roughly eighty to one hundred years, the length of a long human life, with each cycle composed of four eras\u2014or \u201cturnings\u201d\u2014that always arrive in the same order and each last about twenty years. The last of these eras\u2014the fourth turning\u2014was always the most perilous, a period of civic upheaval and national mobilization as traumatic and transformative as the New Deal and World War II, the Civil War, or the American Revolution. Now, right on schedule, our own fourth turning has arrived. And so Neil Howe has returned with an extraordinary new prediction. What we see all around us\u2014the polarization, the growing threat of civil conflict and global war\u2014will culminate by the early 2030s in a climax that poses great danger and yet also holds great promise, perhaps even bringing on America\u2019s next golden age. Every generation alive today will play a vital role in determining how this crisis is resolved, for good or ill. Illuminating, sobering, yet ultimately empowering, The Fourth Turning Is Here takes you back into history and deep into the collective personality of each living generation to make sense of our current crisis, explore how all of us will be differently affected by the political, social, and economic challenges we\u2019ll face in the decade to come, and reveal how our country, our communities, and our families can best prepare to meet these challenges head-on."}, {"rank": 9, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1668015986", "primary_isbn13": "9781668015988", "publisher": "Atria", "description": "The former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security, who revealed himself to be the author of \u201cA Warning,\u201d gives his take on where Trumpism might be headed.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Blowback", "author": "Miles Taylor", "contributor": "by Miles Taylor", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781668015988.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1668015986?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1668015986", "isbn13": "9781668015988"}, {"isbn10": "1668016001", "isbn13": "9781668016008"}, {"isbn10": "1797163930", "isbn13": "9781797163932"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1668015986?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781668015988?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781668015988"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FBLOWBACK%2FMiles%2BTaylor%2F9781668015988"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781668015988"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781668015988?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/b2d4886a-3e74-5dbe-b18a-7b6a61bb5f46", "list_date": "2023/08/06", "published_data": "2023-07-18", "summary": "The author behind the \u201ceye-popping\u201d (CNN) #1 New York Times bestseller A Warning presents an urgent look at how our deeply divided nation is setting the stage for \u201cThe Next Trump.\u201d Donald Trump will be president again, whether he is on the ballot or not. That is because Trumpism is overtaking the Republican Party and will mount a vigorous comeback, potentially in the hands of a savvier successor\u2014The Next Trump. This prophecy will come true, according to Miles Taylor, if we do not learn the lessons of the recent past. With the 2024 election approaching, the formerly \u201cAnonymous\u201d official is back with bombshell revelations and a sobering national forecast. Through interviews with dozens of ex-Trump aides and government leaders, Taylor predicts what could happen inside \u201cTrump 2.0,\u201d the White House of a more competent and more formidable copycat. What sounds like a political thriller\u2014from shadowy presidential powers and CIA betrayals to angry henchmen and assassination plots\u2014is instead America\u2019s political reality, as Taylor uses untold stories to shed light on the ex-President\u2019s unfulfilled plans, the dark forces haunting our civic lives, and how we can thwart the rise of extremism in the United States.

She endured extensive at-home makeovers while Mom chided, \"Your eyelashes are invisible, okay?

In I'm Glad My Mom Died, Jennette recounts all this in unflinching detail--just as she chronicles what happens when the dream finally comes true. Cast in a new Nickelodeon series called iCarly, she is thrust into fame. Though Mom is ecstatic, emailing fan club moderators and getting on a first-name basis with the paparazzi (\"Hi Gale!\"), Jennette is riddled with anxiety, shame, and self-loathing, which manifest into eating disorders, addiction, and a series of unhealthy relationships. These issues only get worse when, soon after taking the lead in the iCarly spinoff Sam & Cat alongside Ariana Grande, her mother dies of cancer. Finally, after discovering therapy and quitting acting, Jennette embarks on recovery and decides for the first time in her life what she really wants.\" -- Amazon.com."}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1419766392", "primary_isbn13": "9781419766398", "publisher": "Abrams", "description": "The actor recounts his misadventures in cryptocurrency and analyzes its decline in value.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Easy Money", "author": "Ben McKenzie with Jacob Silverman", "contributor": "by Ben McKenzie with Jacob Silverman", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781419766398.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1419766392?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1419766392", "isbn13": "9781419766398"}, {"isbn10": "1647009251", "isbn13": "9781647009250"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1419766392?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781419766398?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781419766398"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FEASY%2BMONEY%2FBen%2BMcKenzie%2Bwith%2BJacob%2BSilverman%2F9781419766398"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781419766398"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781419766398?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/6d160d52-9e04-5bea-b561-ce192d4db6ee", "list_date": "2023/08/06", "published_data": "2023-07-18", "summary": "At the height of the pandemic, TV star Ben McKenzie (The O.C., Gotham) was the perfect mark for cryptocurrency: a dad stuck at home with some cash in his pocket, worried about his family, armed with only the vague notion that people were making heaps of money on something he-despite a degree in economics-didn't entirely understand.

When Carol Roth first heard that one of the World Economic Forum's predictions for 2030 was \"You will own nothing, and be happy,\" she thought it was an outlandish fantasy. Then, she researched it. What she found was that a number of businesses, governments, and global elites share a vision of a future that sounds utopian: Everyone will have everything they need, and no one will own anything. From declines in home and vehicle ownership to global inflation and government spending, many of the trends of modern life reveal that a new world that is emerging--one in which Western citizens, by choice or by circumstance, increasingly do not own possessions or accumulate wealth. It's the perfect economic environment for the rich and powerful to solidify their positions and prevent anyone else from getting ahead. In You Will Own Nothing, Roth reveals how the agendas of Wall Street, world governments, international organizations, socialist activists, and multinational corporations like Blackrock all work together to reduce the power of the dollar and prevent millions of Americans from taking control of their wealth. She shows why owning fewer assets makes you poorer and less free.

New York Times best-selling journalist Jeff Goodell presents a searing examination of the impact that temperature rise will have on our lives and on our planet, offering a vital new perspective on where we are headed, how we can prepare, and what is at stake if we fail to act. \"When heat comes, it's invisible. It doesn't bend tree branches or blow hair across your face to let you know it's arrived.... The sun feels like the barrel of a gun pointed at you.\" The world is waking up to a new reality: wildfires are now seasonal in California, the Northeast is getting less and less snow each winter, and the ice sheets in the Arctic and Antarctica are melting fast. Heat is the first order threat that drives all other impacts of the climate crisis. And as the temperature rises, it is revealing fault lines in our governments, our politics, our economy, and our values. The basic science is not complicated: Stop burning fossil fuels tomorrow, and the global temperature will stop rising tomorrow. Stop burning fossil fuels in 50 years, and the temperature will keep rising for 50 years, making parts of our planet virtually uninhabitable. It's up to us. The hotter it gets, the deeper and wider our fault lines will open. The Heat Will Kill You First is about the extreme ways in which our planet is already changing. It is about why spring is coming a few weeks earlier and fall is coming a few weeks later and the impact that will have on everything from our food supply to disease outbreaks. It is about what will happen to our lives and our communities when typical summer days in Chicago or Boston go from 90\u00b0 F to 110\u00b0F. A heatwave, Goodell explains, is a predatory event-- one that culls out the most vulnerable people. But that is changing. As heatwaves become more intense and more common, they will become more democratic. As an award-winning journalist who has been at the forefront of environmental journalism for decades, Goodell's new book may be his most provocative yet, explaining how extreme heat will dramatically change the world as we know it. Masterfully reported, mixing the latest scientific insight with on-the-ground storytelling, Jeff Goodell tackles the big questions and uncovers how extreme heat is a force beyond anything we have reckoned with before."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 14, "weeks_on_list": 6, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "059349993X", "primary_isbn13": "9780593499931", "publisher": "Ballantine", "description": "A hospice nurse shares some of her most impactful experiences and questions some of society's beliefs around end-of-life care.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The In-Between", "author": "Hadley Vlahos", "contributor": "by Hadley Vlahos", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593499931.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/059349993X?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "059349993X", "isbn13": "9780593499931"}, {"isbn10": "0593499948", "isbn13": "9780593499948"}, {"isbn10": "0593668812", "isbn13": "9780593668818"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/059349993X?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593499931?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593499931"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BIN-BETWEEN%2FHadley%2BVlahos%2F9780593499931"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593499931"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593499931?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/9699c550-34ce-56c6-a242-3359bdeca897", "list_date": "2023/08/06", "published_data": "2023-06-13", "summary": "Passionate advocate for end-of-life care and TikTok star Hadley Vlahos shares moving stories of joy, wisdom, and redemption from her patients\u2019 final moments in this deeply personal memoir. \u201cThis extraordinary book helps dispel fear around death and dying\u2014revealing it to be a natural part of our soul\u2019s evolution.\u201d\u2014Laura Lynne Jackson, New York Times bestselling author of Signs and The Light Between Us Talking about death and dying is considered taboo in polite company, and even in the medical field. Our ideas about dying are confusing at best: Will our memories flash before our eyes? Regrets consume our thoughts? Does a bright light appear at the end of a tunnel? For most people, it will be a slower process, one eased with preparedness, good humor, and a bit of faith. At the forefront of changing attitudes around palliative care is hospice nurse Hadley Vlahos, who shows that end-of-life care can teach us just as much about how to live as it does about how we die. Vlahos was raised in a strict religious household, but began questioning her beliefs in high school after the sudden death of a friend. When she got pregnant at nineteen, she was shunned by her community and enrolled herself in nursing school to be able to support herself and her baby. But nursing soon became more than a job: when she focused on palliative care and hospice work, it became a calling. In The In-Between, Vlahos recounts the most impactful experiences she\u2019s had with the people she\u2019s worked with\u2014from the woman who never once questioned her faith until she was close to death, to the older man seeing visions of his late daughter, to the young patient who laments that she spent too much of her short life worrying about what others thought of her\u2014while also sharing her own fascinating journey. Written with profound insight, humility, and respect, The In-Between is a heartrending memoir about that shows how caring for others can transform a life while also offering wisdom and comfort for those dealing with loss and providing inspiration for how to live now."}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 5, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 1, "primary_isbn10": "0063226081", "primary_isbn13": "9780063226081", "publisher": "Broadside", "description": "The Fox News military analyst shares stories from working with veterans for over a decade.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Unbroken Bonds Of Battle", "author": "Johnny Joey Jones", "contributor": "by Johnny Joey Jones", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780063226081.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063226081?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0063226081", "isbn13": "9780063226081"}, {"isbn10": "0063226111", "isbn13": "9780063226111"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063226081?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780063226081?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780063226081"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FUNBROKEN%2BBONDS%2BOF%2BBATTLE%2FJohnny%2BJoey%2BJones%2F9780063226081"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780063226081"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780063226081?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/eb3987a4-4026-5b92-a086-b1dc4dbad328", "list_date": "2023/07/30", "published_data": "2023-05-23", "summary": "Unti FN Nonfiction has descriptive copy which is not yet available from the Publisher."}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 12, "weeks_on_list": 52, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0060959479", "primary_isbn13": "9780060959470", "publisher": "Morrow", "description": "The late feminist icon explores the causes of a polarized society and the meaning of love.", "price": "0.00", "title": "All About Love", "author": "bell hooks", "contributor": "by bell hooks", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780060959470.jpg", "book_image_width": 319, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0060959479?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/30/books/that-4-letter-word.html", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0060959479", "isbn13": "9780060959470"}, {"isbn10": "0062862170", "isbn13": "9780062862174"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0060959479?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780060959470?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780060959470"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FALL%2BABOUT%2BLOVE%2Fbell%2Bhooks%2F9780060959470"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780060959470"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780060959470?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/84ce374b-f6b1-5f05-8556-b0e09e97679c", "list_date": "2023/07/30", "published_data": "2001-01-09", "summary": "\"The word \"love\" is most often defined as a noun, yet...we would all love to better if we used it as a verb,\" writes bell hooks as she comes out fighting and on fire in All About Love.

In its place she offers a proactive new ethic for a people and a society bereft with lovelessness. As bell hooks uses her incisive mind and razor-sharp pen to explode th question \"What is love?\" her answers strike at both the mind and heart. In thirteen concise chapters, hooks examines her own search for emotional connection and society's failure to provide a model for learning to love. Razing the cultural paradigm that the ideal love is infused with sex and desire, she provides a new path to love that is sacred, redemptive, and healing for the individuals and for a nation.

Possessed of a remarkable athleticism and an innate ability to assess practically any security system, Breitwieser managed to pull off a breathtakingly number of audacious thefts.

With humor and heart, she tells of growing up one of the few Asian American kids at her school in Eugene, Oregon; of struggling with her mother's particular, high expectations of her; of a painful adolescence; of treasured months spent in her grandmother's tiny apartment in Seoul, where she and her mother would bond, late at night, over heaping plates of food. As she grew up, moving to the East Coast for college, finding work in the restaurant industry, and performing gigs with her fledgling band--and meeting the man who would become her husband--her Koreanness began to feel ever more distant, even as she found the life she wanted to live. It was her mother's diagnosis of terminal cancer, when Michelle was twenty-five, that forced a reckoning with her identity and brought her to reclaim the gifts of taste, language, and history her mother had given her. Vivacious and plainspoken, lyrical and honest, Zauner's voice is as radiantly alive on the page as it is onstage.

As Happy-Go-Lucky opens, he is learning to shoot guns with his sister, visiting muddy flea markets in Serbia, buying gummy worms to feed to ants, and telling his nonagenarian father wheelchair jokes. But then the pandemic hits, and like so many others, he's stuck in lockdown, unable to tour and read for audiences, the part of his work he loves most. To cope, he walks for miles through a nearly deserted city, smelling only his own breath. He vacuums his apartment twice a day, fails to hoard anything, and contemplates how sex workers and acupuncturists might be getting by during quarantine. As the world gradually settles into a new reality, Sedaris too finds himself changed. His offer to fix a stranger's teeth rebuffed, he straightens his own, and ventures into the world with new confidence. Newly orphaned, he considers what it means, in his seventh decade, no longer to be someone's son. And back on the road, he discovers a battle-scarred America: people weary, storefronts empty or festooned with Help Wanted signs, walls painted with graffiti reflecting the contradictory messages of our time: Eat the Rich. Trump 2024. Black Lives Matter. In Happy-Go-Lucky, David Sedaris once again captures what is most unexpected, hilarious, and poignant about these recent upheavals, personal and public, and expresses in precise language both the misanthropy and desire for connection that drive us all. If we must live in interesting times, there is no one better to chronicle them than the incomparable David Sedaris."}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1324036729", "primary_isbn13": "9781324036722", "publisher": "Norton", "description": "How ultra-processed foods, which are now part of much of what we consume, negatively impact our health and the environment.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Ultra-Processed People", "author": "Chris van Tulleken", "contributor": "by Chris van Tulleken", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781324036722.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1324036729?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1324036729", "isbn13": "9781324036722"}, {"isbn10": "1324036737", "isbn13": "9781324036739"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1324036729?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781324036722?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781324036722"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FULTRA-PROCESSED%2BPEOPLE%2FChris%2Bvan%2BTulleken%2F9781324036722"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781324036722"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781324036722?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/5424aaac-b371-5729-9471-f3420f7971a8", "list_date": "2023/07/16", "published_data": "2023-06-27", "summary": "A manifesto to change how you eat and how you think about the human body."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0358393264", "primary_isbn13": "9780358393269", "publisher": "Mariner", "description": "The Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist examines a cyclical pattern of violence and backlash against racial progress.", "price": "0.00", "title": "American Whitelash", "author": "Wesley Lowery", "contributor": "by Wesley Lowery", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780358393269.jpg", "book_image_width": 333, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0358393264?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0358393264", "isbn13": "9780358393269"}, {"isbn10": "0358394988", "isbn13": "9780358394983"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0358393264?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780358393269?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780358393269"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FAMERICAN%2BWHITELASH%2FWesley%2BLowery%2F9780358393269"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780358393269"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780358393269?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/0bf31293-9b81-5796-add0-c2092e4641e9", "list_date": "2023/07/16", "published_data": "2023-06-27", "summary": "Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Wesley Lowery confronts the sickness at the heart of American society: the cyclical pattern of violence that has marred every moment of racial progress in this country, and whose bloodshed began anew following Obama's 2008 election. In 2008, Barack Obama's historic victory was heralded as a turning point for the country. And so it would be--just not in the way that most Americans hoped. The election of the nation's first Black president fanned long-burning embers of white supremacy, igniting a new and frightening phase in a historical American cycle of racial progress and white backlash. In American Whitelash, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and best-selling author Wesley Lowery charts the return of this blood-stained trend, showing how the forces of white power retaliated against Obama's victory--and both profited from, and helped to propel, the rise of Donald Trump. Interweaving deep historical analysis with gripping firsthand reporting on both victims and perpetrators of violence, Lowery uncovers how this vicious cycle is carrying us into ever more perilous territory, how the federal government has failed to intervene, and how we still might find a route of escape."}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1250276713", "primary_isbn13": "9781250276711", "publisher": "St. Martin's", "description": "The N.B.A. player details the death of his grandfather, who started and operated the first Black-owned service station in North Carolina.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Sixty-One", "author": "Chris Paul with Michael Wilbon", "contributor": "by Chris Paul with Michael Wilbon", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781250276711.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250276713?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1250276713", "isbn13": "9781250276711"}, {"isbn10": "1250276721", "isbn13": "9781250276728"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250276713?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781250276711?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781250276711"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FSIXTY-ONE%2FChris%2BPaul%2Bwith%2BMichael%2BWilbon%2F9781250276711"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781250276711"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250276711?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/4396782a-b5be-541c-90ae-6f464221bec2", "list_date": "2023/07/09", "published_data": "2023-06-20", "summary": "Instant New York Times, USA Today, Publishers Weekly, and Wall Street Journal Bestseller! A powerful and unexpected memoir of family, faith, tragedy, and life's most important lessons. The day after future NBA superstar Chris Paul signed his letter of intent to play college basketball for Wake Forest, he received a world-shattering phone call. His grandfather, Nathaniel \"Papa\" Jones, a pillar of the Winston-Salem community where he owned and operated the first Black-owned service station in North Carolina, was mugged and ultimately died from a heart attack resulting from the assault. His funeral filled the largest church in the county, which held over one thousand people. He was sixty-one years old. The day after burying his grandfather, Chris was coping the best way he knew how: by playing basketball for his high school team. After pouring in shot after shot, his last attempt was an airball purposely flung out of bounds from the foul line before Chris exited the game. The next day, local news headlines declared that he fell six points shy of the statewide single game high school scoring record. But he accomplished exactly what he set out to do: scoring sixty-one points, one for each year of life lived by his grandfather. In Sixty-One, Chris opens up about life beyond basketball and the role his grandfather played in molding him into the man and father he is today. He\u2019ll speak about the foundation of faith and family he built his life upon, what it means to be a positive light within your community and beyond, and the importance of setting the proper example for future generations. Most importantly, Chris will talk about his home, Winston-Salem, and the close-knit family and village that raised him to become one of the most respected leaders in all of sports."}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 14, "weeks_on_list": 24, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593593804", "primary_isbn13": "9780593593806", "publisher": "Random House", "description": "The Duke of Sussex details his struggles with the royal family, loss of his mother, service in the British Army and marriage to Meghan Markle.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Spare", "author": "Prince Harry", "contributor": "by Prince Harry", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593593806.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593593804?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593593804", "isbn13": "9780593593806"}, {"isbn10": "0593593812", "isbn13": "9780593593813"}, {"isbn10": "0593675096", "isbn13": "9780593675090"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593593804?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593593806?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593593806"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FSPARE%2FPrince%2BHarry%2F9780593593806"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593593806"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593593806?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/f65a1f09-ba88-56d7-8674-390729e19b89", "list_date": "2023/07/09", "published_data": "2023-01-10", "summary": "It was one of the most searing images of the twentieth century: two young boys, two princes, walking behind their mother\u2019s coffin as the world watched in sorrow\u2014and horror.

As director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Dr. Anthony Fauci dispenses $6.1 billion in annual taxpayer-provided funding for scientific research, allowing him to dictate the subject, content, and outcome of scientific health research across the globe. Fauci uses the financial clout at his disposal to wield extraordinary influence over hospitals, universities, journals, and thousands of influential doctors and scientists\u2014whose careers and institutions he has the power to ruin, advance, or reward. During more than a year of painstaking and meticulous research, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unearthed a shocking story that obliterates media spin on Dr. Fauci . . . and that will alarm every American\u2014Democrat or Republican\u2014who cares about democracy, our Constitution, and the future of our children\u2019s health. The Real Anthony Fauci reveals how \u201cAmerica\u2019s Doctor\u201d launched his career during the early AIDS crisis by partnering with pharmaceutical companies to sabotage safe and effective off-patent therapeutic treatments for AIDS. Fauci orchestrated fraudulent studies, and then pressured US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulators into approving a deadly chemotherapy treatment he had good reason to know was worthless against AIDS. Fauci repeatedly violated federal laws to allow his Pharma partners to use impoverished and dark-skinned children as lab rats in deadly experiments with toxic AIDS and cancer chemotherapies. In early 2000, Fauci shook hands with Bill Gates in the library of Gates\u2019 $147 million Seattle mansion, cementing a partnership that would aim to control an increasingly profitable $60 billion global vaccine enterprise with unlimited growth potential. Through funding leverage and carefully cultivated personal relationships with heads of state and leading media and social media institutions, the Pharma-Fauci-Gates alliance exercises dominion over global health policy. The Real Anthony Fauci details how Fauci, Gates, and their cohorts use their control of media outlets, scientific journals, key government and quasi-governmental agencies, global intelligence agencies, and influential scientists and physicians to flood the public with fearful propaganda about COVID-19 virulence and pathogenesis, and to muzzle debate and ruthlessly censor dissent."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 11, "weeks_on_list": 5, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1476773920", "primary_isbn13": "9781476773926", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "description": "The Washington Post columnist shares stories and wisdom he learned from a neighbor who was more than a century old.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Book Of Charlie", "author": "David Von Drehle", "contributor": "by David Von Drehle", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781476773926.jpg", "book_image_width": 326, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1476773920?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1476773920", "isbn13": "9781476773926"}, {"isbn10": "1476773947", "isbn13": "9781476773940"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1476773920?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781476773926?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781476773926"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BBOOK%2BOF%2BCHARLIE%2FDavid%2BVon%2BDrehle%2F9781476773926"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781476773926"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781476773926?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/bef88a72-14ad-5736-b3ab-1fcf801e80f9", "list_date": "2023/07/09", "published_data": "2023-05-23", "summary": "\"A veteran Washington journalist recounts his long friendship with Charlie White, the centenarian next door who, sharing his good and meaningful life, mastered survival strategies that reflect thousands of years of human wisdom as his sense of adventure guided him through a century of upheaval.\"--"}, {"rank": 9, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 33, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0316535621", "primary_isbn13": "9780316535625", "publisher": "Little, Brown", "description": "Famous examples of miscommunication serve as the backdrop to explain potential conflicts and misunderstandings.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Talking To Strangers", "author": "Malcolm Gladwell", "contributor": "by Malcolm Gladwell", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780316478526.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 491, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Talking-Strangers-Should-about-People/dp/0316478520?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/books/review-talking-to-strangers-malcolm-gladwell.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0316478520", "isbn13": "9780316478526"}, {"isbn10": "0316535575", "isbn13": "9780316535571"}, {"isbn10": "0316535621", "isbn13": "9780316535625"}, {"isbn10": "1549150340", "isbn13": "9781549150340"}, {"isbn10": "1549150332", "isbn13": "9781549150333"}, {"isbn10": "1549100025", "isbn13": "9781549100024"}, {"isbn10": "1549100017", "isbn13": "9781549100017"}, {"isbn10": "0316299227", "isbn13": "9780316299220"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Talking-Strangers-Should-about-People/dp/0316478520?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780316535625?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780316535625"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTALKING%2BTO%2BSTRANGERS%2FMalcolm%2BGladwell%2F9780316535625"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780316535625"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780316535625?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/74f9a4ee-63c4-5150-bd8d-ab4199ad4c94", "list_date": "2023/07/02", "published_data": "2019-09-10", "summary": "Malcolm Gladwell, host of the podcast Revisionist History and author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Outliers, offers a powerful examination of our interactions with strangers and why they often go wrong\u2014now with a new afterword by the author.

Why did Neville Chamberlain think he could trust Adolf Hitler? Why are campus sexual assaults on the rise? Do television sitcoms teach us something about the way we relate to one another that isn\u2019t true?

In 1933, Hannah Pick-Goslar and her family fled Nazi Germany to live in Amsterdam, where she struck up a close friendship with her next-door neighbor: an outspoken and fun-loving young girl named Anne Frank. For several years, the inseparable pair enjoyed a carefree childhood of games, sleepovers, and treats with the other children in their neighborhood of Rivierenbuurt. But in 1942, Hannah and Anne's lives abruptly changed forever. As the Nazi occupation of Amsterdam progressed, Anne and the Frank family seemingly vanished, leaving behind unmade beds and dishes in the sink--but no trace of Anne's precious diary. Torn apart from her dear friend without warning, Hannah was tormented over Anne's fate, wondering if she had, by some miracle, managed to escape danger. In this long\u2011awaited memoir, Hannah Pick-Goslar shares the incredible story of her childhood during the Holocaust, from the introduction of anti-Jewish laws in Amsterdam, to the gradual disappearance of classmates and, eventually, the Frank family, to Hannah and her family's imprisonment in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. While Hannah chronicles the experiences of her own life during and after the war, she provides a searing look at what countless children endured at the hands of the Nazi regime, as well as an intimate, never\u2011before\u2011seen portrait of the most recognizable victim of the Holocaust. Culminating in an astonishing fateful reunion, My Friend Anne Frank is the profoundly moving story of childhood and friendship during one of the darkest periods of the world's history."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 9, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0063034964", "primary_isbn13": "9780063034969", "publisher": "Broadside", "description": "The Fox News contributor and former congressman argues that liberals remain in power no matter who gets elected.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Puppeteers", "author": "Jason Chaffetz", "contributor": "by Jason Chaffetz", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780063034969.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063034964?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0063034964", "isbn13": "9780063034969"}, {"isbn10": "0063034972", "isbn13": "9780063034976"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063034964?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780063034969?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780063034969"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BPUPPETEERS%2FJason%2BChaffetz%2F9780063034969"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780063034969"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780063034969?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/7d77fe5f-5312-5f98-9164-126e4c29191c", "list_date": "2023/07/02", "published_data": "2023", "summary": "New York Times bestselling author, Fox News contributor, and former Congressman Jason Chaffetz reveals how an unelected bureaucracy--and not just the government--is infringing on our rights.

Instead, one must look closely at the bigger picture, to see how abusers are created, fed, rewarded, allowed to persist, and, with the right tools, how they can be excised. In Burn It Down, veteran reporter Maureen Ryan does just that. She draws on decades of experience to connect the dots and illuminate the deeper forces sustaining Hollywood's corrosive culture. Fresh reporting sheds light on problematic situations at companies like Lucasfilm and shows like Lost, Saturday Night Live, The Goldbergs, Sleepy Hollow, Curb Your Enthusiasm and more. Interviews with actors and famous creatives like Evan Rachel Wood, Harold Perrineau, Damon Lindelof, and Orlando Jones abound. Ryan dismantles, one by one, the myths that the entertainment industry promotes about itself, which have allowed abusers to thrive and the industry to avoid accountability--myths about Hollywood as a meritocracy, what it takes to be creative, the value of human dignity, and more. Weaving together insights from industry insiders, historical context, and pop-culture analysis, Burn It Down paints a groundbreaking and urgently necessary portrait of what's gone wrong in the entertainment world--and how we can fix it."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 11, "weeks_on_list": 5, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1250890926", "primary_isbn13": "9781250890924", "publisher": "Holt", "description": "The host and executive producer of \u201cWatch What Happens Live\u201d juggles fatherhood and his career.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Daddy Diaries", "author": "Andy Cohen", "contributor": "by Andy Cohen", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781250890924.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250890926?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1250890926", "isbn13": "9781250890924"}, {"isbn10": "1250890934", "isbn13": "9781250890931"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250890926?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781250890924?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781250890924"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BDADDY%2BDIARIES%2FAndy%2BCohen%2F9781250890924"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781250890924"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250890924?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/dfb17d10-d212-5376-8a5f-192c0a9856f4", "list_date": "2023/06/25", "published_data": "2023-05-09", "summary": "The Instant New York Times Bestseller!

Andy Cohen has taken on the most important job of his life\u2014father\u2014 and boy (and girl!) does he have a lot to say about it! One of Andy Cohen\u2019s most momentous years starts off with a hangover the morning after an epic New Year\u2019s Eve broadcast. But Andy doesn\u2019t have time to dwell on the drama, as his role as media mogul is now matched with the responsibilities, joys, and growing pains of parenthood. This fast-paced, mile-a-minute look behind the scenes of living the so-called glamorous life in Manhattan now takes firm aim at life at home. With a three-year-old son, Ben, and a daughter, Lucy, born in May, stories of late-night parties are replaced by early mornings with Ben, drama at the play-ground, and the musings of a single dad trying to navigate having it all. All this is set against the backdrop of constant Housewives drama, hijinks behind the scenes at Watch What Happens Live, a revolving door of famous faces, and a worried mother (and newly minted grandmother) in St. Louis.

Vividly written and exhaustively researched, Jonathan Eig\u2019s King: A Life is the first major biography in decades of the civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr.\u2014and the first to include recently declassified FBI files. In this revelatory new portrait of the preacher and activist who shook the world, the bestselling biographer gives us an intimate view of the courageous and often emotionally troubled human being who demanded peaceful protest for his movement but was rarely at peace with himself. He casts fresh light on the King family\u2019s origins as well as MLK\u2019s complex relationships with his wife, father, and fellow activists. King reveals a minister wrestling with his own human frailties and dark moods, a citizen hunted by his own government, and a man determined to fight for justice even if it proved to be a fight to the death. As he follows MLK from the classroom to the pulpit to the streets of Birmingham, Selma, and Memphis, Eig dramatically re-creates the journey of a man who recast American race relations and became our only modern-day founding father\u2014as well as the nation\u2019s most mourned martyr. In this landmark biography, Eig gives us an MLK for our times: a deep thinker, a brilliant strategist, a perplexing husband and father, and a committed radical who led one of history\u2019s greatest movements, and whose demands for racial and economic justice remain as urgent today as they were in his lifetime.

The girls bonded over a shared love of reading and learning, even as they navigated the challenges of their tumultuous family lives and declining town\u2014broken marriages, alcohol abuse, and shuttered stores and factories. They pored over the giant map in their middle-school classroom, tracing their fingers over the world that awaited them, vowing to escape. In the end, Monica left Clinton for college and fulfilled her dreams, but Darci, along with many in their circle of friends, did not. Years later, working as a journalist covering poverty, Potts discovered what she already intuitively knew about the women in Arkansas: Their life expectancy had dropped steeply\u2014the sharpest such fall in a century. This decline has been attributed to \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d\u2014suicide, alcoholism, and drug overdoses\u2014but Potts knew their causes were too complex to identify in a sociological study. She had grown up with these women, and when she saw Darci again, she found that her childhood friend\u2014addicted to drugs, often homeless, a single mother\u2014was now on track to becoming a statistic. In this gripping narrative, Potts deftly pinpoints the choices that sent her and Darci on such different paths and then widens the lens to explain why those choices are so limited. The Forgotten Girls is a profound, compassionate look at a population in trouble, and a uniquely personal account of the way larger forces, such as inheritance, education, religion, and politics, shape individual lives."}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "059324303X", "primary_isbn13": "9780593243039", "publisher": "Dial", "description": "An examination of the seven deadly sins and their influence over the lives of women today.", "price": "0.00", "title": "On Our Best Behavior", "author": "Elise Loehnen", "contributor": "by Elise Loehnen", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593243039.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/059324303X?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "059324303X", "isbn13": "9780593243039"}, {"isbn10": "0593243048", "isbn13": "9780593243046"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/059324303X?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593243039?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593243039"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FON%2BOUR%2BBEST%2BBEHAVIOR%2FElise%2BLoehnen%2F9780593243039"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593243039"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593243039?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/b9c29714-39b5-561d-a365-04d3fad34e34", "list_date": "2023/06/11", "published_data": "2023-05-23", "summary": "A groundbreaking exploration of the ancient rules women unwittingly follow in order to be considered \u201cgood,\u201d revealing how the Seven Deadly Sins still control and distort our lives and illuminating a path toward a more balanced, spiritually complete way to live Why do women equate self-denial with being good? We congratulate ourselves when we resist the donut in the office breakroom. We celebrate our restraint when we hold back from sending an email in anger. We feel virtuous when we wake up at dawn to get a jump on the day. We put others\u2019 needs ahead of our own and believe this makes us exemplary. In On Our Best Behavior, journalist Elise Loehnen explains that these impulses\u2014often lauded as unselfish, distinctly feminine instincts\u2014are actually ingrained in us by a culture that reaps the benefits, via an extraordinarily effective collection of mores known as the Seven Deadly Sins. Since being codified by the Christian church in the fourth century, the Seven Deadly Sins\u2014pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath, and sloth\u2014have exerted insidious power. Even today, in our largely secular, patriarchal society, they continue to circumscribe women\u2019s behavior. For example, seeing sloth as sinful leads women to deny themselves rest; a fear of gluttony drives them to ignore their appetites; and an aversion to greed prevents them from negotiating for themselves and contributes to the 55 percent gender wealth gap. In On Our Best Behavior, Loehnen reveals how we\u2019ve been programmed to obey the rules represented by these sins and how doing so qualifies us as \u201cgood.\u201d This probing analysis of contemporary culture and thoroughly researched history explains how women have internalized the patriarchy, and how they unwittingly reinforce it. By sharing her own story and the spiritual wisdom of other traditions, Loehnen shows how we can break free and discover the integrity and wholeness we seek."}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0063112361", "primary_isbn13": "9780063112360", "publisher": "Harper", "description": "Rudolf Vrba, who became one of the first Jews to escape from Auschwitz, warned others about the death camp.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Escape Artist", "author": "Jonathan Freedland", "contributor": "by Jonathan Freedland", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780063112360.jpg", "book_image_width": 332, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063112361?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0063112361", "isbn13": "9780063112360"}, {"isbn10": "006311237X", "isbn13": "9780063112377"}, {"isbn10": "0063112337", "isbn13": "9780063112339"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063112361?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780063112360?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780063112360"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BESCAPE%2BARTIST%2FJonathan%2BFreedland%2F9780063112360"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780063112360"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780063112360?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/92040f7d-a902-57f0-ae7f-166447a440a1", "list_date": "2023/06/11", "published_data": "2023-03-07", "summary": "\"A brilliant and heart-wrenching book, with universal and timely lessons about the power of information -- and misinformation. Is it possible to stop mass murder by telling the truth?\" -- Yuval Noah Harari, bestselling author of Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind and Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow A complex hero. A forgotten story. The first witness to reveal the full truth of the Holocaust . . . Award-winning journalist and bestselling novelist Jonathan Freedland tells the incredible story of Rudolf Vrba--one of the very first Jews to break out of Auschwitz and make his way to freedom, a man determined to warn the world and pass on a truth too few were willing to hear--elevating him to his rightful place in the annals of World War II alongside Anne Frank, Primo Levi, and Oskar Schindler and casting a new light on the Holocaust and its aftermath. In April 1944, Rudolf Vrba became one of the very first Jews to break out of Auschwitz and make his way to freedom--one of only a tiny handful who ever pulled off that near-impossible feat. He did it to reveal the truth of the death camp to the world--and to warn the last Jews of Europe what fate awaited them at the end of the railway line. Against all odds, he and his fellow escapee, Fred Wetzler, climbed mountains, crossed rivers and narrowly missed German bullets until they had smuggled out the first full account of Auschwitz the world had ever seen--a forensically detailed report that would eventually reach Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and the Pope. And yet too few heeded the warning that Vrba--then just nineteen years old--had risked everything to deliver. Some could not believe it. Others thought it easier to keep quiet. Vrba helped save 200,000 Jewish lives--but he never stopped believing it could have been so many more. This is the story of a brilliant yet troubled man--a gifted \"escape artist\" who even as a teenager understand that the difference between truth and lies can be the difference between life and death, a man who deserves to take his place alongside Anne Frank, Oskar Schindler and Primo Levi as one of the handful of individuals whose stories define our understanding of the Holocaust."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1250847745", "primary_isbn13": "9781250847744", "publisher": "Forge", "description": "The comedian and Emmy-nominated TV writer explains the cultural and culinary significance of hot dogs.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Raw Dog", "author": "Jamie Loftus", "contributor": "by Jamie Loftus", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781250847744.jpg", "book_image_width": 324, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250847745?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1250847745", "isbn13": "9781250847744"}, {"isbn10": "1250847753", "isbn13": "9781250847751"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250847745?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781250847744?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781250847744"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FRAW%2BDOG%2FJamie%2BLoftus%2F9781250847744"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781250847744"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250847744?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/f6a80eac-7452-5707-83f7-94f2bbf43dbe", "list_date": "2023/06/11", "published_data": "2023-05-09", "summary": "Part travelogue, part culinary history, all capitalist critique\u2014comedian Jamie Loftus's debut, Raw Dog, will take you on a cross-country road trip in the summer of 2021, and reveal what the creation, culture, and class influence of hot dogs says about America now. Hot dogs. Poor people created them. Rich people found a way to charge fifteen dollars for them. They\u2019re high culture, they\u2019re low culture, they\u2019re sports food, they\u2019re hangover food, and they\u2019re deeply American, despite having no basis whatsoever in America's Indigenous food traditions. You can love them, you can hate them, you can cut them up and put them in a bowl of macaroni and cheese, but you can\u2019t avoid the great American hot dog. Raw Dog: The Naked Truth About Hot Dogs is part investigation into the cultural and culinary significance of hot dogs and part travelogue documenting a cross-country road trip researching the landscape of American hot dogs as they\u2019re served today. From avocado and spice in the West to ass-shattering chili in the East to an entire salad on a slice of meat in Chicago, Loftus, her pets and her ex eat their way across the country during the strange summer of 2021, a brief window of the year between waves of a plague that the American government has the resources to temper, but not the interest. Loftus weighs in on: - The reality of hot dog production and working conditions, from factories to fast food stands, in a post-Upton Sinclair world, - The subcultures thriving around hot dogs, from competitive eaters to Wienermobile drivers, - The baffling number of anthropomorphic pickle brands in the U.S., - And yes, critically overlooked bun infrastructure problems.

There is Hongwu, the beggar who founded the Ming dynasty; Ewuare, the Leopard-King of Benin; Henry Christophe, King of Haiti; Kamehameha, the conqueror of Hawaii; Zenobia, the Arab empress who defied Rome; Lady Murasaki, the first female novelist; Sayyida al-Hurra, the Moroccan pirate-queen.

I found stories I experienced, lessons I learned and forgot, poems, prayers, prescriptions, beliefs about what matters, some great photographs, and a whole bunch of bumper stickers. I found a reliable theme, an approach to living that gave me more satisfaction, at the time, and still: If you know how, and when, to deal with life\u2019s challenges\u2014how to get relative with the inevitable\u2014you can enjoy a state of success I call \u201ccatching greenlights.\u201d So I took a one-way ticket to the desert and wrote this book: an album, a record, a story of my life so far. This is fifty years of my sights and seens, felts and figured-outs, cools and shamefuls. Graces, truths, and beauties of brutality. Getting away withs, getting caughts, and getting wets while trying to dance between the raindrops. Hopefully, it\u2019s medicine that tastes good, a couple of aspirin instead of the infirmary, a spaceship to Mars without needing your pilot\u2019s license, going to church without having to be born again, and laughing through the tears. It\u2019s a love letter. To life. It\u2019s also a guide to catching more greenlights\u2014and to realizing that the yellows and reds eventually turn green too. Good luck. The short dust jacket included with this hardcover edition is an intentional design choice."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 9, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1368095054", "primary_isbn13": "9781368095051", "publisher": "Andscape", "description": "Essays by celebrities about the teachers who impacted their lives.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Lessons Learned And Cherished", "author": "Deborah Roberts", "contributor": "by Deborah Roberts", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781368095051.jpg", "book_image_width": 333, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1368095054?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1368095054", "isbn13": "9781368095051"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1368095054?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781368095051?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781368095051"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FLESSONS%2BLEARNED%2BAND%2BCHERISHED%2FDeborah%2BRoberts%2F9781368095051"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781368095051"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781368095051?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/b3103e9f-01ca-5520-8676-586cd9958528", "list_date": "2023/05/28", "published_data": "2023-05-02", "summary": "A giftable collection of essays from celebrity contributors celebrating the great work of teachers or a teacher they admire, curated by ABC journalist Deborah Roberts.

Its moral force is a gut punch.\u201d\u2014The New Yorker ONE OF THE MOST ANTICIPATED BOOKS OF 2023: The Washington Post, Time, Esquire, Newsweek, Minneapolis Star Tribune, Elle, Salon, Lit Hub, Kirkus Reviews The United States, the richest country on earth, has more poverty than any other advanced democracy. Why? Why does this land of plenty allow one in every eight of its children to go without basic necessities, permit scores of its citizens to live and die on the streets, and authorize its corporations to pay poverty wages? In this landmark book, acclaimed sociologist Matthew Desmond draws on history, research, and original reporting to show how affluent Americans knowingly and unknowingly keep poor people poor. Those of us who are financially secure exploit the poor, driving down their wages while forcing them to overpay for housing and access to cash and credit. We prioritize the subsidization of our wealth over the alleviation of poverty, designing a welfare state that gives the most to those who need the least. And we stockpile opportunity in exclusive communities, creating zones of concentrated riches alongside those of concentrated despair. Some lives are made small so that others may grow. Elegantly written and fiercely argued, this compassionate book gives us new ways of thinking about a morally urgent problem. It also helps us imagine solutions. Desmond builds a startlingly original and ambitious case for ending poverty. He calls on us all to become poverty abolitionists, engaged in a politics of collective belonging to usher in a new age of shared prosperity and, at last, true freedom."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "153872037X", "primary_isbn13": "9781538720370", "publisher": "Grand Central", "description": "Conversations on personal subjects from a mother and daughter who are also award-winning actresses.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Honey, Baby, Mine", "author": "Laura Dern and Diane Ladd", "contributor": "by Laura Dern and Diane Ladd", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781538720370.jpg", "book_image_width": 385, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/153872037X?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "153872037X", "isbn13": "9781538720370"}, {"isbn10": "1538710218", "isbn13": "9781538710210"}, {"isbn10": "1538720353", "isbn13": "9781538720356"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/153872037X?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781538720370?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781538720370"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FHONEY%252C%2BBABY%252C%2BMINE%2FLaura%2BDern%2Band%2BDiane%2BLadd%2F9781538720370"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781538720370"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781538720370?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/c69c9942-3b3d-5ede-9a8d-cc89557ee1e9", "list_date": "2023/05/14", "published_data": "2023-04-25", "summary": "A collection of deeply personal conversations from award-winning actress and activist Laura Dern and the woman she admires most, her mother--legendary actress Diane Ladd--that take readers on an intimate tour of their lives, sharing their most honest conversations on love, life, success, and everything in between. Award-winning actresses and mother-daughter duo Laura Dern and Diane Ladd are the kind of women who draw strength from their lifelong friendships with other women, and most of all, from each other. Ever since Laura was born, the two have leaned on one another through the trials of everyday life and the tribulations that come with even the most storied Hollywood careers. They were always close, but when Diane developed a sudden illness, their relationship grew even deeper. When a doctor prescribed long walks to build back Diane's lung capacity, the pair began taking strolls together every day. These meandering walks soon became epic ones, and the conversations the two women shared began to break down the traditional barriers between mothers and daughters. With topics ranging from ambition and legacy to intimacy and marriage, ranging from humorous to deeply poignant, nothing was off limits. By the time Diane was healed they were more than a close pair; they had covered tremendous ground and formed a true friendship. Peppered throughout these intimate exchanges, they enclose personal photos, family recipes, and much more. The result is a book that will make you want to call your own mom--a testament to the intimacy that can be achieved when we are brave enough to speak our truths to those we love most."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0735225265", "primary_isbn13": "9780735225268", "publisher": "Viking", "description": "The Pulitzer and National Book Award-winning author details the Ku Klux Klan's rise to the height of its power in the 1920s and how one brutalized woman\u2019s testimony diminished it.", "price": "0.00", "title": "A Fever In The Heartland", "author": "Timothy Egan", "contributor": "by Timothy Egan", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780735225268.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0735225265?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0735225265", "isbn13": "9780735225268"}, {"isbn10": "0735225273", "isbn13": "9780735225275"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0735225265?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780735225268?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780735225268"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FA%2BFEVER%2BIN%2BTHE%2BHEARTLAND%2FTimothy%2BEgan%2F9780735225268"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780735225268"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780735225268?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/e0f59871-698a-5cb4-8b22-6b43e21ec8d2", "list_date": "2023/05/14", "published_data": "2023-04-04", "summary": "\"With meticulous detective work, Timothy Egan shines a light on one of the most sinister chapters in American history\u2014how a viciously racist movement, led by a murderous conman, rose to power in the early twentieth century. A Fever in the Heartland is compelling, powerful, and profoundly resonant today.\" -- David Grann, author of THE WAGER and KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON A historical thriller by the Pulitzer and National Book Award-winning author that tells the riveting story of the Klan's rise to power in the 1920s, the cunning con man who drove that rise, and the woman who stopped them. The Roaring Twenties--the Jazz Age--has been characterized as a time of Gatsby frivolity. But it was also the height of the uniquely American hate group, the Ku Klux Klan. Their domain was not the old Confederacy, but the Heartland and the West. They hated Blacks, Jews, Catholics and immigrants in equal measure, and took radical steps to keep these people from the American promise. And the man who set in motion their takeover of great swaths of America was a charismatic charlatan named D.C. Stephenson. Stephenson was a magnetic presence whose life story changed with every telling. Within two years of his arrival in Indiana, he\u2019d become the Grand Dragon of the state and the architect of the strategy that brought the group out of the shadows \u2013 their message endorsed from the pulpits of local churches, spread at family picnics and town celebrations. Judges, prosecutors, ministers, governors and senators across the country all proudly proclaimed their membership. But at the peak of his influence, it was a seemingly powerless woman \u2013 Madge Oberholtzer \u2013 who would reveal his secret cruelties, and whose deathbed testimony finally brought the Klan to their knees.

Over the next decade, she traveled six hundred thousand miles across fifty states\u2014from Seminole country (now known as the Everglades) to Inuit territory (now known as the Bering Sea)\u2014to meet, interview, and photograph hundreds of Indigenous people. The body of work Wilbur created serves to counteract the one-dimensional and archaic stereotypes of Native people in mainstream media and offers justice to the richness, diversity, and lived experiences of Indian Country. The culmination of this decade-long art and storytelling endeavor, Project 562 is a peerless, sweeping, and moving love letter to Indigenous Americans, containing hundreds of stunning portraits and compelling personal narratives of contemporary Native people\u2014all photographed in clothing, poses, and locations of their choosing. Their narratives touch on personal and cultural identity as well as issues of media representation, sovereignty, faith, family, the protection of sacred sites, subsistence living, traditional knowledge-keeping, land stewardship, language preservation, advocacy, education, the arts, and more.

Never having run for office before, Katie Porter charted a new path in 2018 when she was elected to Congress as a Democrat in historically conservative Orange County, California. Underestimated as a single mom and chided for her progressive values, Katie defied expectations. Then, using her signature whiteboard, she began to take CEOs and corrupt government officials to task in Congressional hearings. The videos went viral, introducing Americans to her no-bullshit style, and making her a coveted guest on cable news and late-night television. I SWEAR: Politics Is Messier Than My Minivan is a witty, down-to-earth exploration of what it\u2019s really like to serve in Congress, particularly as a single mom. Katie offers Americans a clear picture of what their elected leaders are doing\u2014and how they\u2019re doing it\u2014exposing the gaps between politicians\u2019 press conferences and real people\u2019s lives. Katie reveals how her challenges as an Iowa farmgirl diverted her to the Ivy League and how she came to see herself as a Californian, teaching law and raising three kids in Orange County. She shares why she made the jump from academia to politics and how she quickly mastered the art of making CEOs and cabinet members squirm when they bluff and bloviate instead of doing the job for America. With the same clarity she demonstrates in Congressional hearings, Katie makes the case for consumer protection, corporate accountability, and anti-corruption reforms. She pulls back the curtain on the political messaging machine, campaign fundraising, and Congress\u2019 traditions, showing that the way things have always worked, in fact, does not work for a Congressperson without someone at home to do the shopping and take care of the kids. Along the way, she provides whiteboard lessons on where your campaign donations go, how to fight the corporations that cheat you, and how to conduct her trademark robust oversight.

The book begins with one woman\u2019s personal, particular heartbreak, but its circles widen into a reckoning with contemporary womanhood, traditional gender roles, and the power dynamics that persist even in many progressive homes. With the spirit of self-inquiry and empathy she\u2019s known for, Smith interweaves snapshots of a life with meditations on secrets, anger, forgiveness, and narrative itself. The power of these pieces is cumulative: page after page, they build into a larger interrogation of family, work, and patriarchy. You Could Make This Place Beautiful, like the work of Deborah Levy, Rachel Cusk, and Gina Frangello, is an unflinching look at what it means to live and write our own lives. It is a story about a mother\u2019s fierce and constant love for her children, and a woman\u2019s love and regard for herself. Above all, this memoir is an argument for possibility. With a poet\u2019s attention to language and an innovative approach to the genre, Smith reveals how, in the aftermath of loss, we can discover our power and make something new.

The time for do-overs is over. Ever since she became a parent, Mary Louise Kelly has said \u201cnext year.\u201d Next year will be the year she makes it to her son James\u2019s soccer games (which are on weekdays at 4 p.m., right when she is on the air on NPR\u2019s All Things Considered, talking to millions of listeners). Drive carpool for her son Alexander? Not if she wants to do that story about Ukraine and interview the secretary of state. Like millions of parents who wrestle with raising children while pursuing a career, she has never been cavalier about these decisions. The bargain she has always made with herself is this: this time I\u2019ll get on the plane, and next year I\u2019ll find a way to be there for the mom stuff. Well, James and Alexander are now seventeen and fifteen, and a realization has overtaken Mary Louise: her older son will be leaving soon for college. There used to be years to make good on her promises; now, there are months, weeks, minutes. And with the devastating death of her beloved father, Mary Louise is facing act three of her life head-on. Mary Louise is coming to grips with the reality every parent faces. Childhood has a definite expiration date. You have only so many years with your kids before they leave your house to build their own lives. It\u2019s what every parent is supposed to want, what they raise their children to do. But it is bittersweet. Mary Louise is also dealing with the realities of having aging parents. This pivotal time brings with it the enormous questions of what you did right and what you did wrong. This chronicle of her eldest child\u2019s final year at home, of losing her father, as well as other curve balls thrown at her, is not a definitive answer\u2015not for herself and certainly not for any other parent.

Pondering this mystery led Hawking to study the big bang origin of the universe, but his early work ran into a crisis when the math predicted many big bangs producing a multiverse\u2014countless different universes, most far too bizarre to harbor life. Holed up in the theoretical physics department at Cambridge, Stephen Hawking and his friend and collaborator Thomas Hertog worked shoulder to shoulder for twenty years on a new quantum theory of the cosmos. As their journey took them deeper into the big bang, they were startled to find a deeper level of evolution in which the physical laws themselves transform and simplify until particles, forces, and even time itself fades away. Once upon a time, perhaps, there was no time. This led them to a revolutionary idea: the laws of physics are not set in stone but are born and co-evolve as the universe they govern takes shape. On the Origin of Time takes the reader on a quest to understand questions bigger than our universe, peering into the extreme quantum physics of black holes and the big bang and drawing on the latest developments in string theory. As Hawking's final days drew near, the two collaborators developed a final theory proposing their radical new Darwinian perspective on the origins of our universe. Hertog offers a striking new vision that ties together more deeply than ever the nature of the universe\u2019s birth with our existence. This new theory profoundly transforms the way we think about our place in the order of the cosmos and may ultimately prove Hawking\u2019s biggest legacy."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 8, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1368073565", "primary_isbn13": "9781368073561", "publisher": "Hyperion Avenue", "description": "The ESPN host partners with his producer to create their list of top 100 sports legends.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Got Your Number", "author": "Mike Greenberg with Paul Hembekides", "contributor": "by Mike Greenberg with Paul Hembekides", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781368073561.jpg", "book_image_width": 333, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1368073565?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1368073565", "isbn13": "9781368073561"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1368073565?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781368073561?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781368073561"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FGOT%2BYOUR%2BNUMBER%2FMike%2BGreenberg%2Bwith%2BPaul%2BHembekides%2F9781368073561"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781368073561"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781368073561?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/937f6e54-2c76-5a3d-af4f-e5731a47b136", "list_date": "2023/04/30", "published_data": "2023-04-04", "summary": "ESPN personality (Get Up and #Greeny) and New York Times bestselling author Mike Greenberg partners with mega-producer Hembo to settle once and for all which legends flat-out own which numbers.

Cheering on, agonizing over, and being in plain awe of your favorite players has left you with a deep and intricate memory of their greatness, not to mention well-honed arguments as to why your favorites are really the best.

You\u2019ve spouted accomplishments, statistics: Yours won six titles, batted .350 in the clutch, or generated 82% of their team\u2019s scoring. But not all numbers are created equal. Some are accomplishments. Others are identity. Looming large over any image you have of an athlete: the number on their jersey.

When Des woke up on April 16, 2018, the morning of the Boston Marathon, it was 39 degrees and raining, with high, gusty winds. The weather didn\u2019t bother her. In fact, she thought it might be a blessing. She was far from peak form\u2014recovering from illness and questioning her running future\u2014and didn\u2019t expect much of herself that day. But as she ticked off mile after mile in the brutal conditions, passing familiar landmarks on the course she knew by heart, something shifted. Opportunity unexpectedly presented itself. Des tapped into her inner strength and remembered all of the reasons she loved to race. Coming off Heartbreak Hill at Mile 22, Des took the lead and never relinquished it, becoming the 2018 Boston Marathon champion and the first American woman to win the race in thirty-three years. Her career has always been defined by tenacity and an independent spirit, stretching back to her first competitive race in San Diego, when she beat better-outfitted, more experienced kids. Des was a two-time All-American at Arizona State University, and as her collegiate years wound down, she decided she wasn\u2019t done with the sport. Des gambled on herself and moved to Michigan to give professional running a try. As she rose through the elite ranks, she became increasingly determined to do things her way in an industry often bound by the status quo. In her first book, readers will learn the story behind that resolve: the way Des trains, the way she thinks, her relationships with other great runners of her generation, and how much she values her family and friends. They\u2019ll read about her deep connection to the most famous marathon in the world, her two very different Olympic experiences, and how she defined new goals and set a world record at the 50-kilometer distance. Most of all, they\u2019ll learn what makes her get up and run every day."}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 7, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0316406600", "primary_isbn13": "9780316406604", "publisher": "Little, Brown", "description": "A collection of stories about police officers.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Walk The Blue Line", "author": "James Patterson and Matt Eversmann with Chris Mooney", "contributor": "by James Patterson and Matt Eversmann with Chris Mooney", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780316406604.jpg", "book_image_width": 323, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316406600?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0316406600", "isbn13": "9780316406604"}, {"isbn10": "0316406708", "isbn13": "9780316406703"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316406600?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780316406604?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780316406604"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FWALK%2BTHE%2BBLUE%2BLINE%2FJames%2BPatterson%2Band%2BMatt%2BEversmann%2Bwith%2BChris%2BMooney%2F9780316406604"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780316406604"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780316406604?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/2b496a38-e72d-5612-8686-460c5c20c0e0", "list_date": "2023/04/23", "published_data": "2023-02-06", "summary": "They risk their lives every day to protect and serve our homes, families and communities.

Over the course of his career, seasoned war correspondent Benjamin Hall covered some of the deadliest armed conflicts of our time, including violence in Syria, Libya, and Somalia. But with a young family at home, Hall chose to trade life on the edge for a safer beat covering the US Department of State. Then Russia viciously attacked Ukraine in February 2022. Though he knew the dangers of war and was no longer traveling to war zones, Hall quickly accepted the assignment. He had to tell this story--Americans needed to understand the gravity of this stunning, world-altering conflict. Though he had witnessed and survived years of violence, on March 14, a month into the invasion of Ukraine, Hall and his crew were hit by a Russian drone strike, killing his cameraman and a fellow journalist and gravely injuring him. Stuck inside the warzone, it was feared Hall might not make it out alive. This is the story of how he survived--including his dramatic rescue and his arduous and ongoing recovery. For the first time, Hall shares his experiences in full--of his time in Ukraine and on the frontlines of the world's most perilous conflicts, of the terrible attack that nearly killed him, of the love of his family, of the strength and perseverance it has taken to endure multiple surgeries and learn how to walk again. Going inside the events that have permanently transformed him, Hall speaks honestly about the struggle to step away from the peril and how his years of experience kept him safe--until they failed him. And he pays tribute to American service members who not only helped save him, but decades earlier rescued his father, who, during World War II at age twelve, escaped a Japanese camp in the Philippines and eventually reached American GIs. Most remarkably, Hall's spirit has remained undaunted throughout his ordeal--a spirit of hope and positivity which infuses this exceptional story. Evocative, harrowing, and deeply moving, Untitled is a powerful memoir of family and perseverance, of life and healing, and of what to do when you are tested in ways you never thought possible.

Now, he reveals how he did it. He played baseball for Yale, graduated with honors from Harvard Law School, and served in Iraq and in the halls of Congress. But in all these places, Ron DeSantis learned the same lesson: He didn't want to be part of the leftist elite. His heart was always for the people of Florida, one of the most diverse and culturally rich states in the union. Since becoming governor of the sunshine state, he has fought --and won--battle after battle, defeating not just opposition from the political left, but a barrage of hostile media coverage proclaiming the end of the world. When he implemented evidence-based and freedom-focused COVID-19 policies, the press launched a smear campaign against him, yet Florida's economy thrived, its education system outperformed the nation, and its COVID mortality rate for seniors was lower than that in 38 states. When he enacted policies to keep leftist political concepts like critical race theory and woke gender ideology out of Florida's classrooms, the media demagogued his actions, but parents across Florida rallied to his cause. Dishonest attacks from the media don't deter him. In fact, DeSantis keeps racking up wins for Floridians. A firsthand account from the blue-collar boy who grew up to take on Disney and Dr. Fauci, The Courage to Be Free delivers something no other politician's memoir has before: stories of victory. This book is a winning blueprint for patriots across the country. And it is a rallying cry for every American who wishes to preserve our liberties."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1324006501", "primary_isbn13": "9781324006503", "publisher": "Norton", "description": "A look at the religious dimensions of American politics.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Undertow", "author": "Jeff Sharlet", "contributor": "by Jeff Sharlet", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781324006503.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1324006498?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1324006501", "isbn13": "9781324006503"}, {"isbn10": "1324006498", "isbn13": "9781324006497"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1324006498?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781324006503?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781324006503"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BUNDERTOW%2FJeff%2BSharlet%2F9781324006503"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781324006503"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781324006503?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/0f46fcdb-d3e9-5cfd-a9ae-f81fcdecf461", "list_date": "2023/04/16", "published_data": "2023-03-21", "summary": "An Instant New York Times Bestseller. One of America\u2019s finest reporters and essayists explores the powerful currents beneath the roiled waters of a nation coming apart. An unmatched guide to the religious dimensions of American politics, Jeff Sharlet journeys into corners of our national psyche where others fear to tread. The Undertow is both inquiry and meditation, an attempt to understand how, over the last decade, reaction has morphed into delusion, social division into distrust, distrust into paranoia, and hatred into fantasies\u2014sometimes realities\u2014of violence. Across the country, men \u201cof God\u201d glorify materialism, a gluttony of the soul, while citing Scripture and preparing for civil war\u2014a firestorm they long for as an absolution and exaltation. Lies, greed, and glorification of war boom through microphones at hipster megachurches that once upon a time might have preached peace and understanding. Political rallies are as aflame with need and giddy expectation as religious revivals. At a conference for incels, lonely single men come together to rage against women. On the Far Right, everything is heightened\u2014love into adulation, fear into vengeance, anger into white-hot rage. Here, in the undertow, our forty-fifth president, a vessel of conspiratorial fears and fantasies, continues to rise to sainthood, and the insurrectionist Ashli Babbitt, killed on January 6 at the Capitol, is beatified as a martyr of white womanhood. Framing this dangerous vision, Sharlet remembers and celebrates the courage of those who sing a different song of community, and of an America long dreamt of and yet to be fully born, dedicated to justice and freedom for all. Exploring a geography of grief and uncertainty in the midst of plague and rising fascism, The Undertow is a necessary reckoning with our precarious present that brings to light a decade of American failures as well as a vision for American possibility."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 24, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0374533555", "primary_isbn13": "9780374533557", "publisher": "Farrar, Straus & Giroux", "description": "The winner of the Nobel in economic science discusses how we make choices.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Thinking, Fast And Slow", "author": "Daniel Kahneman", "contributor": "by Daniel Kahneman", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781429969352.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 490, "amazon_product_url": "http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman-ebook/dp/B00555X8OA?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/books/review/thinking-fast-and-slow-by-daniel-kahneman-book-review.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/books/review/thinking-fast-and-slow-by-daniel-kahneman-book-review.html", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0374275637", "isbn13": "9780374275631"}, {"isbn10": "0739357980", "isbn13": "9780739357989"}, {"isbn10": "0374533555", "isbn13": "9780374533557"}, {"isbn10": "0606275649", "isbn13": "9780606275644"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman-ebook/dp/B00555X8OA?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780374533557?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780374533557"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHINKING%252C%2BFAST%2BAND%2BSLOW%2FDaniel%2BKahneman%2F9780374533557"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780374533557"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780374533557?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/1e1ffccd-d526-5154-84de-1628b31454e9", "list_date": "2023/04/16"}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 6, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0063224623", "primary_isbn13": "9780063224629", "publisher": "Dey Street", "description": "The entrepreneur and pop culture icon shares her personal and professional rise in the age of influencers.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Paris", "author": "Paris Hilton", "contributor": "by Paris Hilton", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780063224629.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063224623?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0063224623", "isbn13": "9780063224629"}, {"isbn10": "0063224631", "isbn13": "9780063224636"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063224623?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780063224629?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780063224629"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FPARIS%2FParis%2BHilton%2F9780063224629"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780063224629"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780063224629?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/70018f37-a19d-59d7-9ede-71cb917bd6cf", "list_date": "2023/04/16", "published_data": "2023-03-14", "summary": "Behind Paris Hilton's meteoric rise from Upper West Side club kid to household name lies her self-proclaimed \"superpower\" of ADHD and a hidden history that traumatized and defined her. Shocking, funny, and surprisingly profound, Paris is the deeply personal memoir of the ultimate It Girl and a stunning inside view of a pop culture phenomenon. Until, in a revealing documentary, Paris Hilton disclosed that her childhood was shattered by two years of strip searches, isolation, beatings, restraint, and brainwashing within the now infamous \"troubled teen industry,\" Paris Hilton was simply the billionaire heiress America had watched grow up on television, on the internet, and in tabloids. But there was always more to Paris Hilton than met the eye. Yes, she is the media personality, DJ, entrepreneur, model, singer, actress, and icon beloved all over the globe. And yet... Paris is the story people have always wanted Paris Hilton to tell--the story of who she really is. In this revealing and thought-provoking book, Hilton will separate the creation from the creator, the brand from the ambassador, and show the woman who grew up with incredible privilege but was also trapped in a world of unreasonable expectation at a moment when young women were humiliated for sport in a gossip economy on steroids. Paris recounts her perilous journey through pre-#METOO sexual politics with grace, generosity, and plenty of fun, rising above a series of heart-wrenching challenges to find healing, lasting love, and a life of meaning and purpose. The parallel story arcs in Hilton's braided narrative come to full bloom as a watershed portrait of the Aughts, challenging each of us to question our role in her story and her role in ours. The result is an intimate and unexpected memoir about persona and personification, the price of being young and disobedient, and the complexity of manifesting your dreams after watching part of yourself disappear."}, {"rank": 9, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0063221349", "primary_isbn13": "9780063221345", "publisher": "HarperOne", "description": "A collection of essays on journalism and finding commonalities by the host of NPR\u2019s \u201cAll Things Considered.\u201d", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Best Strangers In The World", "author": "Ari Shapiro", "contributor": "by Ari Shapiro", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780063221345.jpg", "book_image_width": 333, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063221349?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0063221349", "isbn13": "9780063221345"}, {"isbn10": "0063221365", "isbn13": "9780063221369"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063221349?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780063221345?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780063221345"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BBEST%2BSTRANGERS%2BIN%2BTHE%2BWORLD%2FAri%2BShapiro%2F9780063221345"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780063221345"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780063221345?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/f5940f02-0fc8-57db-8045-e20bae2a5f1a", "list_date": "2023/04/09", "published_data": "2023-03-21", "summary": "From the beloved host of NPR's All Things Considered, a stirring memoir-in-essays that is also a lover letter to journalism.

In 1943, as the war against Nazi Germany raged abroad, President Franklin Roosevelt had a critical goal: a face-to-face sit-down with his allies Joseph Stalin and Winston Churchill. This first-ever meeting of the Big Three in Tehran, Iran, would decide some of the most crucial strategic details of the war. Yet when the Nazis found out about the meeting, their own secret plan took shape\u2014an assassination plot that would\u2019ve changed history. A true story filled with daring rescues, body doubles, and political intrigue, The Nazi Conspiracy details FDR\u2019s pivotal meeting in Tehran and the deadly Nazi plot against the heads of state of the three major Allied powers who attended it.

Reflecting on our turbulent times, Senator Bernie Sanders takes on the billionaire class and speaks blunt truths about our country\u2019s failure to address the destructive nature of a system that is fueled by uncontrolled greed and rigidly committed to prioritizing corporate profits over the needs of ordinary Americans. Sanders argues that unfettered capitalism is to blame for an unprecedented level of income and wealth inequality, is undermining our democracy, and is destroying our planet. How can we accept an economic order that allows three billionaires to control more wealth than the bottom half of our society? How can we accept a political system that allows the super rich to buy elections and politicians? How can we accept an energy system that rewards the fossil fuel corporations causing the climate crisis? Sanders believes that, in the face of these overwhelming challenges, the American people must ask tough questions about the systems that have failed us and demand fundamental economic and political change. This is where the path forward begins. It\u2019s OK to Be Angry About Capitalism presents a vision that extends beyond the promises of past campaigns to reveal what would be possible if the political revolution took place, if we would finally recognize that economic rights are human rights, and if we would work to create a society that provides a decent standard of living for all.

She excelled at running from a young age, and though she was confronted with serious challenges including the death of her father and struggles with disordered eating, her prospects were bright. She won high school cross country championships in Minnesota, NCAA track and field championships at the University of Colorado, and when she graduated from college, Nike offered her a sponsorship deal. Alberto Salazar was a legend of American distance running. He ran at the University of Oregon, made two Olympic teams, and won the New York and Boston marathons in the 1980s. In the early 2000s he was hired by Nike as a coach to build a team that would reestablish the United States as a distance running powerhouse. Dubbed the Nike Oregon Project, it would be based at the company's spectacular headquarters near Portland. In 2004, Kara and her Olympian-runner husband, Adam, were invited by Alberto to move to Oregon and join the elite team. It seemed the opportunity of a lifetime and the start of her dreams coming true. But behind the scenes, Salazar was hiding dark secrets beneath his charming persona. Narcissistic and power hungry, he demanded complete control over his runners, pushing and then crossing the limits of anti-doping rules and even promoting a culture of abuse. Told with stunning honesty, The Longest Race is an unforgettable story and a call to action. Overcoming the powerful forces compelling her to remain silent, Kara became a key witness helping to get Salazar banned for life from professional coaching, as well as a crusader for female athletes. Ultimately, she reveals how she broke through the fear of losing everything she ever worked for, took back control of her life and career, and reclaimed her love of the sport of running.\"--"}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 11, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593329996", "primary_isbn13": "9780593329993", "publisher": "Riverhead", "description": "The author of \u201cWintering\u201d shares her journey to reconnect with her sense of wonder and awe.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Enchantment", "author": "Katherine May", "contributor": "by Katherine May", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593329993.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593329996?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593329996", "isbn13": "9780593329993"}, {"isbn10": "0593330013", "isbn13": "9780593330012"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593329996?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593329993?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593329993"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FENCHANTMENT%2FKatherine%2BMay%2F9780593329993"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593329993"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593329993?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/88ef102a-ec71-5590-9798-e8908fb5081f", "list_date": "2023/04/02", "published_data": "2023-02-28", "summary": "#1 NATIONAL BESTSELLER \u201cI love Katherine May\u2019s new book, Enchantment.\u2026It\u2019s a beautiful offering of light, truth and charm in these strange, dark times.\u201d \u2013 New York Times bestselling author Anne Lamott \u201cKatherine May gave so many of us language and vision for the long communal \u2018wintering\u2019 of the last years.

We feel fearful and tired, on edge in our bodies, not quite knowing what has us perpetually depleted. For Katherine May, this low hum of fatigue and anxiety made her wonder what she was missing. Could there be a different way to relate to the world, one that would allow her to feel more rested and at ease, even as seismic changes unfold on the planet? Might there be a way for all of us to move through life with curiosity and tenderness, sensitized to the subtle magic all around? In Enchantment, May invites the reader to come with her on a journey to reawaken our innate sense of wonder and awe. With humor, candor, and warmth, she shares stories of her own struggles with work, family, and the aftereffects of pandemic, particularly feelings of overwhelm as the world rushes to reopen. Craving a different way to live, May begins to explore the restorative properties of the natural world, moving through the elements of earth, water, fire, and air and identifying the quiet traces of magic that can be found only when we look for them. Through deliberate attention and ritual, she unearths the potency and nourishment that come from quiet reconnection with our immediate environment. Blending lyricism and storytelling, sensitivity and empathy, Enchantment invites each of us to open the door to human experience in all its sensual complexity, and to find the beauty waiting for us there."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0063220431", "primary_isbn13": "9780063220430", "publisher": "Harper", "description": "The co-host of \u201cCBS Saturday Morning\u201d chronicles her search for her mother and efforts to make sense of her mixed-race heritage.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Belonging", "author": "Michelle Miller with Rosemarie Robotham", "contributor": "by Michelle Miller with Rosemarie Robotham", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780063220430.jpg", "book_image_width": 338, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063220431?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0063220431", "isbn13": "9780063220430"}, {"isbn10": "0063220458", "isbn13": "9780063220454"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063220431?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780063220430?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780063220430"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FBELONGING%2FMichelle%2BMiller%2Bwith%2BRosemarie%2BRobotham%2F9780063220430"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780063220430"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780063220430?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/92a59748-7386-5303-ae38-f3c0b82d01ed", "list_date": "2023/04/02", "published_data": "2023-03-14", "summary": "The award-winning journalist and co-host of CBS Saturday Morning tells the candid, and deeply personal story of her mother's abandonment and how the search for answers forced her to reckon with her own identity and the secrets that shaped her family for five decades. Though Michelle Miller was an award-winning broadcast journalist for CBS News, few people in her life knew the painful secret she carried: her mother had abandoned her at birth. Los Angeles in 1967 was deeply segregated, and her mother--a Chicana hospital administrator who presented as white, had kept her affair with Michelle's father, Dr. Ross Miller, a married trauma surgeon and Compton's first Black city councilman--hidden, along with the unplanned pregnancy. Raised largely by her father and her paternal grandmother, Michelle had no knowledge of the woman whose genes she shared. Then, fate intervened when Michelle was twenty-two. As her father lay stricken with cancer, he told her, \"Go and find your mother.\" Belonging is the chronicle of Michelle's decades-long quest to connect with the woman who gave her life, to confront her past, and ultimately, to find her voice as a journalist, a wife, and a mother. Michelle traces the years spent trying to make sense of her mixed-race heritage and her place in white-dominated world. From the wealthy white schools where she was bussed to integrate, to the newsrooms filled with white, largely male faces, she revisits the emotional turmoil of her formative years and how the enigma of her mother and her rejection shaped Michelle's understanding of herself and her own Blackness. As she charts her personal journey, Michelle looks back on her decades on the ground reporting painful events, from the beating of Rodney King to the death of George Floyd, revealing how her struggle to understand her racial identity coincides with the nation's own ongoing and imperfect racial reckoning. What emerges is an intimate family story about secrets--secrets we keep, secrets we share, and the secrets that make us who we are."}, {"rank": 9, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "059324270X", "primary_isbn13": "9780593242704", "publisher": "Random House", "description": "The author of \"How to Do Nothing\" looks at how we experience time and what we could do to reclaim it.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Saving Time", "author": "Jenny Odell", "contributor": "by Jenny Odell", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593242704.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/059324270X?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "059324270X", "isbn13": "9780593242704"}, {"isbn10": "0593242718", "isbn13": "9780593242711"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/059324270X?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593242704?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593242704"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FSAVING%2BTIME%2FJenny%2BOdell%2F9780593242704"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593242704"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593242704?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/715aa72d-93b5-53a3-92d6-16960736d809", "list_date": "2023/03/26", "published_data": "2023-03-07", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 From the author of How to Do Nothing comes a \u201cparadigm-destroying new book . . . about the various problems that swirl out from dominant conceptions of \u2018time\u2019\u201d (The New York Times Editors\u2019 Choice). \u201cSaving Time\u2019s real triumph lies in her road map for experiencing time outside the capitalist clock. . . .

But what if you don\u2019t have time to spend? In order to answer this seemingly simple question, Odell took a deep dive into the fundamental structure of our society and found that the clock we live by was built for profit, not people. This is why our lives, even in leisure, have come to seem like a series of moments to be bought, sold, and processed ever more efficiently. Odell shows us how our painful relationship to time is inextricably connected not only to persisting social inequities but to the climate crisis, existential dread, and a lethal fatalism. This dazzling, subversive, and deeply hopeful book offers us different ways to experience time\u2014inspired by pre-industrial cultures, ecological cues, and geological timescales\u2014that can bring within reach a more humane, responsive way of living. As planet-bound animals, we live inside shortening and lengthening days alongside gardens growing, birds migrating, and cliffs eroding; the stretchy quality of waiting and desire; the way the present may suddenly feel marbled with childhood memory; the slow but sure procession of a pregnancy; the time it takes to heal from injuries. Odell urges us to become stewards of these different rhythms of life in which time is not reducible to standardized units and instead forms the very medium of possibility. Saving Time tugs at the seams of reality as we know it\u2014the way we experience time itself\u2014and rearranges it, imagining a world not centered on work, the office clock, or the profit motive.

In this revolutionary book, renowned physician Gabor Mat\u00e9 eloquently dissects how in Western countries that pride themselves on their healthcare systems, chronic illness and general ill health are on the rise. Nearly 70 percent of Americans are on at least one prescription drug; more than half take two. In Canada, every fifth person has high blood pressure. In Europe, hypertension is diagnosed in more than 30 percent of the population. And everywhere, adolescent mental illness is on the rise. So what is really \u201cnormal\u201d when it comes to health? Over four decades of clinical experience, Mat\u00e9 has come to recognize the prevailing understanding of \u201cnormal\u201d as false, neglecting the roles that trauma and stress, and the pressures of modern-day living, exert on our bodies and our minds at the expense of good health. For all our expertise and technological sophistication, Western medicine often fails to treat the whole person, ignoring how today\u2019s culture stresses the body, burdens the immune system, and undermines emotional balance.

FINALIST FOR THE KIRKUS PRIZE \u2022 ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: The Washington Post, NPR, Esquire, Marie Claire, Electric Lit, Ms. magazine, Kirkus Reviews, Booklist In late August 1619, a ship arrived in the British colony of Virginia bearing a cargo of twenty to thirty enslaved people from Africa. Their arrival led to the barbaric and unprecedented system of American chattel slavery that would last for the next 250 years. This is sometimes referred to as the country\u2019s original sin, but it is more than that: It is the source of so much that still defines the United States. The New York Times Magazine\u2019s award-winning \u201c1619 Project\u201d issue reframed our understanding of American history by placing slavery and its continuing legacy at the center of our national narrative. This new book substantially expands on that work, weaving together eighteen essays that explore the legacy of slavery in present-day America with thirty-six poems and works of fiction that illuminate key moments of oppression, struggle, and resistance. The essays show how the inheritance of 1619 reaches into every part of contemporary American society, from politics, music, diet, traffic, and citizenship to capitalism, religion, and our democracy itself. This is a book that speaks directly to our current moment, contextualizing the systems of race and caste within which we operate today. It reveals long-glossed-over truths around our nation\u2019s founding and construction\u2014and the way that the legacy of slavery did not end with emancipation, but continues to shape contemporary American life.

Its founder and head, ninety-three-year-old Sumner M. Redstone, was facing a very public lawsuit brought by a former romantic companion, Manuela Herzer\u2014a lawsuit that placed Sumner\u2019s deteriorating health and questionable judgment under a harsh light. As one of the last in a long line of all-powerful media moguls, Sumner had been a relentlessly demanding boss, and an even more demanding father. When his daughter, Shari, took control of her father\u2019s business, she faced the hostility of boards and management who for years had heard Sumner disparage her. Les Moonves, the popular CEO of CBS, felt particularly threatened and schemed with his allies on the board to strip Shari of power. But while he publicly battled Shari, news began to leak that Moonves had been involved in multiple instances of sexual misconduct, and he began working behind the scenes to try to make the stories disappear. Unscripted is an explosive and unvarnished look at the usually secret inner workings of two public companies, their boards of directors, and a wealthy, dysfunctional family in the throes of seismic changes, from the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists James B. Stewart and Rachel Abrams. Through the microcosm of Paramount, whose once victorious business model of cable fees and ticket sales is crumbling under the assault of technological advances, and whose workplace is undergoing radical change in the wake of #MeToo, Black Lives Matter, and a distaste for the old guard, Stewart and Abrams lay bare the battle for power at any price\u2014and the carnage that ensued."}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 7, "weeks_on_list": 4, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0063226561", "primary_isbn13": "9780063226562", "publisher": "Dey Street", "description": "The actress and activist details her childhood, rise to fame and the ways she is reclaiming the narrative of her life.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Love, Pamela", "author": "Pamela Anderson", "contributor": "by Pamela Anderson", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780063226562.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063226561?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0063226561", "isbn13": "9780063226562"}, {"isbn10": "0063226588", "isbn13": "9780063226586"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063226561?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780063226562?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780063226562"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FLOVE%252C%2BPAMELA%2FPamela%2BAnderson%2F9780063226562"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780063226562"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780063226562?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/98619bb7-9b22-53e4-8da8-b9f7e4bec0ae", "list_date": "2023/03/12", "published_data": "2023-01-24", "summary": "A heartrending, intimate memoir from the iconic pin-up and Playboy's last great Playmate"}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 8, "weeks_on_list": 5, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0451499786", "primary_isbn13": "9780451499783", "publisher": "Crown", "description": "The author of \u201cQuiet\u201d suggests ways to embrace loss and suffering within ourselves and others.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Bittersweet", "author": "Susan Cain", "contributor": "by Susan Cain", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780451499783.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0451499786?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0451499786", "isbn13": "9780451499783"}, {"isbn10": "0451499808", "isbn13": "9780451499806"}, {"isbn10": "0593506065", "isbn13": "9780593506066"}, {"isbn10": "0593506057", "isbn13": "9780593506059"}, {"isbn10": "0451499794", "isbn13": "9780451499790"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0451499786?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780451499783?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780451499783"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FBITTERSWEET%2FSusan%2BCain%2F9780451499783"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780451499783"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780451499783?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/d312abb9-9d34-5782-b0ac-b2becc574a6d", "list_date": "2023/03/12", "published_data": "2022-04-05", "summary": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 OPRAH\u2019S BOOK CLUB PICK \u2022 Sadness is your superpower.

It recognizes that light and dark, birth and death\u2014bitter and sweet\u2014are forever paired. If you\u2019ve ever wondered why you like sad music . . . If you find comfort or inspiration in a rainy day . . . If you react intensely to music, art, nature, and beauty . . . Then you probably identify with the bitter\u00adsweet state of mind. With Quiet, Susan Cain urged our society to cultivate space for the undervalued, indispensable introverts among us, thereby revealing an un\u00adtapped power hidden in plain sight. Now she em\u00adploys the same mix of research, storytelling, and memoir to explore why we experience sorrow and longing, and how embracing the bittersweetness at the heart of life is the true path to creativity, con\u00adnection, and transcendence. Cain shows how a bittersweet state of mind is the quiet force that helps us transcend our personal and collective pain, whether from a death or breakup, addiction or illness. If we don\u2019t acknowledge our own heartache, she says, we can end up inflicting it on others via abuse, domination, or neglect. But if we realize that all humans know\u2014or will know\u2014loss and suffering, we can turn toward one another. At a time of profound discord and personal anxiety, Bittersweet brings us together in deep and unexpected ways."}, {"rank": 9, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593492307", "primary_isbn13": "9780593492307", "publisher": "Penguin Press", "description": "The activist exposes greenwashing efforts and shares insights from leaders in various fields about climate challenges.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Climate Book", "author": "Greta Thunberg", "contributor": "by Greta Thunberg", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593492307.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593492307?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593492307", "isbn13": "9780593492307"}, {"isbn10": "0593492315", "isbn13": "9780593492314"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593492307?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593492307?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593492307"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BCLIMATE%2BBOOK%2FGreta%2BThunberg%2F9780593492307"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593492307"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593492307?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/10a968aa-ce7f-5e48-ba96-6f2c3fe9309e", "list_date": "2023/03/05", "published_data": "2023-02-14", "summary": "We still have time to change the world. From Greta Thunberg, the world's leading climate activist, comes the essential handbook for making it happen. You might think it's an impossible task: secure a safe future for life on Earth, at a scale and speed never seen, against all the odds. There is hope - but only if we listen to the science before it's too late. In The Climate Book, Greta Thunberg has gathered the wisdom of over one hundred experts - geophysicists, oceanographers and meteorologists; engineers, economists and mathematicians; historians, philosophers and indigenous leaders - to equip us all with the knowledge we need to combat climate disaster. Throughout, illuminating and often shocking grayscale charts, graphs, diagrams, photographs, and illustrations underscore their research and their arguments. Alongside them, she shares her own stories of demonstrating and uncovering greenwashing around the world, revealing how much we have been kept in the dark. This is one of our biggest challenges, she shows, but also our greatest source of hope. Once we are given the full picture, how can we not act?

Now, he reveals how he did it, and how it could happen again. Mike Pompeo is the only person ever to have served as both America's most senior diplomat and the head of its premier espionage agency. As the only four-year national security member of President Trump's Cabinet, he worked to impose crushing pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran, avert a nuclear crisis with North Korea, deliver unmatched support for Israel, and bring peace to the Middle East. Drawing on his commitment to America's founding principles and his Christian faith, his efforts to promote religious freedom around the world were unequaled in American diplomatic history. Most importantly, he led a much-needed generational transformation of America's relationship with China. Blending remarkable and often humorous stories of his interactions with world leaders and unmatched analysis of geopolitics, Never Give an Inch tells of how Pompeo helped the Trump Administration craft the America First approach that upended Washington wisdom--and made him America's enemies' worst nightmare. It is a raw account of what it took to deliver winning outcomes in the face of a progressive activist media, partisan conspiracies, two impeachments and endless investigations, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Complete with a road map of the trends and players shaping the world today, Never Give an Inch is more than a historical review of the Trump Administration's greatest victories. It is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the challenges of the future. And it is an inspirational story of leadership through dangerous times that will leave you with a greater appreciation for America."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 8, "weeks_on_list": 16, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1250866448", "primary_isbn13": "9781250866448", "publisher": "Flatiron", "description": "The actor, known for playing Chandler Bing on \u201cFriends,\u201d shares stories from his childhood and his struggles with sobriety.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Friends, Lovers, And The Big Terrible Thing", "author": "Matthew Perry", "contributor": "by Matthew Perry", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781250866448.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250866448?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1250866448", "isbn13": "9781250866448"}, {"isbn10": "1250866464", "isbn13": "9781250866462"}, {"isbn10": "1250867061", "isbn13": "9781250867063"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250866448?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781250866448?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781250866448"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FFRIENDS%252C%2BLOVERS%252C%2BAND%2BTHE%2BBIG%2BTERRIBLE%2BTHING%2FMatthew%2BPerry%2F9781250866448"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781250866448"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250866448?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/04988f91-5b03-5eb4-ae17-89fda0e7051a", "list_date": "2023/03/05", "published_data": "2022-11", "summary": "\"The beloved star of Friends takes us behind the scenes of the hit sitcom and his struggles with addiction in this candid, funny, and revelatory memoir that delivers a powerful message of hope and persistence In an extraordinary story that only he could tell, Matthew Perry takes readers onto the soundstage of the most successful sitcom of all time while opening up about his private struggles with addiction.

Mark Pomerantz was a retired lawyer living a calm suburban life when he accepted an unexpected offer to join the staff of the district attorney of New York County in February 2021 to work on the investigation of former president Donald Trump. The Manhattan DA was interested in Pomerantz because he brought vast experience in litigating white collar and organized crime cases, having worked as a federal prosecutor and a criminal defense attorney for decades. Pomerantz had prosecuted and defended cases involving murder, drug trafficking, political corruption, tax evasion, and financial fraud. His clients had included governors and senators, business leaders, financial institutions, and also gangsters and murderers. Over the next year, Pomerantz investigated the world of Donald Trump and the Trump Organization. He interviewed potential witnesses, scrutinized financial records, and learned everything he could about Trump\u2019s business practices. The investigation led him to believe that the former president\u2019s approach to business had much in common with the business practices of another well-known public figure\u2014former mob boss John J. Gotti. Ultimately, Pomerantz gathered enough evidence to support the view\u2014held by many of his colleagues on the case, including former Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.\u2014that former president Donald Trump should be indicted for a number of financial crimes. But that indictment never happened. This book explains why. Pomerantz\u2019s work ultimately led to the indictment of the Trump Organization and Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, who pleaded guilty to tax fraud. But that indictment was merely the prelude to a larger criminal case that Pomerantz urged the Manhattan DA, Alvin Bragg, to bring against Donald Trump. When the DA refused to authorize that prosecution, Pomerantz and his colleague Carey Dunne resigned. Aspects of the case Pomerantz wanted to bring are currently being pursued against Trump by the attorney general of New York State in a civil fraud case that does not involve criminal penalties. In People vs. Donald Trump, Pomerantz tells the story of his unprecedented investigation, why he believes Donald Trump should be prosecuted, and what we can learn about the nature of justice in America from this extraordinary case. Pomerantz draws from a lifetime of legal experience to tell a devastating and frequently entertaining story of how prosecutors think, how criminals act, and how our justice system works\u2014and sometimes doesn\u2019t work. Pomerantz has written a cautionary tale that illuminates the challenges of prosecuting Donald Trump, why Trump manages to dance between the raindrops of accountability, and how others might bring him to justice."}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1982199539", "primary_isbn13": "9781982199531", "publisher": "Gallery", "description": "A star of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Salt Lake City\u201d describes leaving the Mormon Church and finding success as a businesswoman and single mother.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Bad Mormon", "author": "Heather Gay", "contributor": "by Heather Gay", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781982199531.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982199539?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1982199539", "isbn13": "9781982199531"}, {"isbn10": "1982199555", "isbn13": "9781982199555"}, {"isbn10": "1797144367", "isbn13": "9781797144368"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982199539?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781982199531?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781982199531"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FBAD%2BMORMON%2FHeather%2BGay%2F9781982199531"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781982199531"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781982199531?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/7f23c1b8-b9b1-509a-8020-9d02b6fa18ca", "list_date": "2023/02/26", "published_data": "2023-02-07", "summary": "\"The funny, brash, and vulnerable memoir from the star of Bravo's The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City bravely explores her leaving the Mormon Church and her journey to success in business, television, and single motherhood.

Cobalt Red is the searing, first-ever expos\u00e9 of the immense toll taken on the people and environment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo by cobalt mining, as told through the testimonies of the Congolese people themselves. Activist and researcher Siddharth Kara has traveled deep into cobalt territory to document the testimonies of the people living, working, and dying for cobalt. To uncover the truth about brutal mining practices, Kara investigated militia-controlled mining areas, traced the supply chain of child-mined cobalt from toxic pit to consumer-facing tech giants, and gathered shocking testimonies of people who endure immense suffering and even die mining cobalt. Cobalt is an essential component to every lithium-ion rechargeable battery made today, the batteries that power our smartphones, tablets, laptops, and electric vehicles. Roughly 75 percent of the world\u2019s supply of cobalt is mined in the Congo, often by peasants and children in sub-human conditions. Billions of people in the world cannot conduct their daily lives without participating in a human rights and environmental catastrophe in the Congo.

Hated and hailed, excoriated and revered, Abraham Lincoln was at the pinnacle of American power when implacable secessionists gave no quarter in a clash of visions bound up with money, race, identity, and faith. In him we can see the possibilities of the presidency as well as its limitations. At once familiar and elusive, Lincoln tends to be seen as the greatest of American presidents\u2014a remote icon\u2014or as a politician driven more by calculation than by conviction. This illuminating new portrait gives us a very human Lincoln\u2014an imperfect man whose moral antislavery commitment, essential to the story of justice in America, began as he grew up in an antislavery Baptist community; who insisted that slavery was a moral evil; and who sought, as he put it, to do right as God gave him to see the right. This book tells the story of Lincoln from his birth on the Kentucky frontier in 1809 to his leadership during the Civil War to his tragic assassination in 1865: his rise, his self-education, his loves, his bouts of depression, his political failures, his deepening faith, and his persistent conviction that slavery must end. In a nation shaped by the courage of the enslaved of the era and by the brave witness of Black Americans, Lincoln\u2019s story illustrates the ways and means of politics in a democracy, the roots and durability of racism, and the capacity of conscience to shape events."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 7, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1982189495", "primary_isbn13": "9781982189495", "publisher": "Gallery/13A", "description": "The ESPN analyst recounts the highs and lows of his life and career.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Straight Shooter", "author": "Stephen A.

Stephen A. Smith has never been handed anything, nor was he an overnight success. Growing up poor in Queens, the son of Caribbean immigrants and the youngest of six children, he was a sports-obsessed kid who faced a number of struggles, from undiagnosed dyslexia to getting enough cereal to fill his bowl. As a basketball player at Winston-Salem State University, he got a glimmer of his true calling when he wrote a newspaper column arguing for the retirement of his own Hall of Fame coach, Clarence Gaines. Smith hustled and rose up from a high school reporter at Daily News (New York) to a general sports columnist at The Philadelphia Inquirer in the 1990s, before getting his own show at ESPN in 2005. After he was unceremoniously fired from the network in 2009, he became even more determined to fight for success. He got himself rehired two years later and, with his razor-sharp intelligence and fearless debate style, found his role on the show he was destined to star in: First Take, the network\u2019s flagship morning program. In Straight Shooter, Smith writes about the greatest highs and deepest lows of his life and career. He gives his thoughts on Skip Bayless, Ray Rice, Colin Kaepernick, the New York Knicks, the Dallas Cowboys, and former President Donald Trump. But he also pulls back the curtain and talks about life beyond the set, sharing authentic stories about his negligent father, his loving mother, being a father himself, his battle with life-threatening COVID-19, and what he really thinks about politics and social issues. He does it all with the same intelligence, humor, and charm that has made him a household name. Provocative, moving, and eye-opening, this book is the perfect gift for lovers of sports, television, and anyone who likes their stories delivered straight to the heart."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1501191055", "primary_isbn13": "9781501191053", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "description": "In 1848, Ellen Craft, disguised as a disabled white man, and her husband, William, posing as that man\u2019s slave, achieved freedom only to have to flee again.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Master Slave Husband Wife", "author": "Ilyon Woo", "contributor": "by Ilyon Woo", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781501191053.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1501191055?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1501191055", "isbn13": "9781501191053"}, {"isbn10": "1501191071", "isbn13": "9781501191077"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1501191055?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781501191053?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781501191053"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FMASTER%2BSLAVE%2BHUSBAND%2BWIFE%2FIlyon%2BWoo%2F9781501191053"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781501191053"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781501191053?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/63a05029-23af-5d43-a316-6d7af1a9bfd3", "list_date": "2023/02/19", "published_data": "2023-01-17", "summary": "Presents the remarkable true story of Ellen and William Craft, who escaped slavery through daring, determination, and disguise, with Ellen passing as a wealthy, disabled white man and William posing as \"his\" slave."}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0525560653", "primary_isbn13": "9780525560654", "publisher": "Penguin Press", "description": "The president of the Council on Foreign Relations makes his case for what he considers obligations for American citizens.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Bill Of Obligations", "author": "Richard Haass", "contributor": "by Richard Haass", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780525560654.jpg", "book_image_width": 333, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525560653?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0525560653", "isbn13": "9780525560654"}, {"isbn10": "0525560661", "isbn13": "9780525560661"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525560653?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780525560654?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780525560654"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BBILL%2BOF%2BOBLIGATIONS%2FRichard%2BHaass%2F9780525560654"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780525560654"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780525560654?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/907da459-176e-5d35-b85e-aba80b3924ee", "list_date": "2023/02/12", "published_data": "2023-01-24", "summary": "A New York Times Bestseller A provocative guide to how we must reenvision citizenship if American democracy is to survive The United States faces dangerous threats from Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, terrorists, climate change, and future pandemics. The greatest peril to the country, however, comes not from abroad but from within, from none other than ourselves. The question facing us is whether we are prepared to do what is necessary to save our democracy. The Bill of Obligations is a bold call for change. In these pages, New York Times bestselling author Richard Haass argues that the very idea of citizenship must be revised and expanded. The Bill of Rights is at the center of our Constitution, yet our most intractable conflicts often emerge from contrasting views as to what our rights ought to be. As former Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer pointed out, \u201cMany of our cases, the most difficult ones, are not about right versus wrong. They are about right versus right.\u201d The lesson is clear: rights alone cannot provide the basis for a functioning, much less flourishing, democracy. But there is a cure: to place obligations on the same footing as rights. The ten obligations that Haass introduces here are essential for healing our divisions and safeguarding the country\u2019s future. These obligations reenvision what it means to be an American citizen. They are not a burden but rather commitments that we make to fellow citizens and to the government to uphold democracy and counter the growing apathy, anger, selfishness, division, disinformation, and violence that threaten us all. Through an expert blend of civics, history, and political analysis, this book illuminates how Americans can rediscover and recover the attitudes and behaviors that have contributed so much to this country\u2019s success over the centuries. As Richard Haass argues, \u201cWe get the government and the country we deserve. Getting the one we need, however, is up to us.\u201d The Bill of Obligations gives citizens across the political spectrum a plan of action to achieve it."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593138538", "primary_isbn13": "9780593138533", "publisher": "Crown", "description": "Potential causes for diminishing attention spans and how corporations might raid our attention for profit.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Stolen Focus", "author": "Johann Hari", "contributor": "by Johann Hari", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593138519.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593138511?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593138511", "isbn13": "9780593138519"}, {"isbn10": "059313852X", "isbn13": "9780593138526"}, {"isbn10": "0593138538", "isbn13": "9780593138533"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593138511?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593138533?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593138533"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FSTOLEN%2BFOCUS%2FJohann%2BHari%2F9780593138533"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593138533"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593138533?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/cfcbbc66-9014-572b-a471-477797523387", "list_date": "2023/02/12", "published_data": "2023-01-24", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 Our ability to pay attention is collapsing.

Like so many of us, Johann Hari was finding that constantly switching from device to device and tab to tab was a diminishing and depressing way to live. He tried all sorts of self-help solutions\u2014even abandoning his phone for three months\u2014but nothing seemed to work. So Hari went on an epic journey across the world to interview the leading experts on human attention\u2014and he discovered that everything we think we know about this crisis is wrong. We think our inability to focus is a personal failure to exert enough willpower over our devices. The truth is even more disturbing: our focus has been stolen by powerful external forces that have left us uniquely vulnerable to corporations determined to raid our attention for profit. Hari found that there are twelve deep causes of this crisis, from the decline of mind-wandering to rising pollution, all of which have robbed some of our attention. In Stolen Focus, he introduces readers to Silicon Valley dissidents who learned to hack human attention, and veterinarians who diagnose dogs with ADHD. He explores a favela in Rio de Janeiro where everyone lost their attention in a particularly surreal way, and an office in New Zealand that discovered a remarkable technique to restore workers\u2019 productivity. Crucially, Hari learned how we can reclaim our focus\u2014as individuals, and as a society\u2014if we are determined to fight for it. Stolen Focus will transform the debate about attention and finally show us how to get it back."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1250877520", "primary_isbn13": "9781250877529", "publisher": "Celadon", "description": "The final report of the Select Committee to Investigate the Jan. 6.

The people, places, and possibilities in my life. Surrender is a word freighted with meaning for me. Growing up in Ireland in the seventies with my fists up (musically speaking), it was not a natural concept. A word I only circled until I gathered my thoughts for the book. I am still grappling with this most humbling of commands. In the band, in my marriage, in my faith, in my life as an activist. Surrender is the story of one pilgrim\u2019s lack of progress ...

But in Surrender, it\u2019s Bono who picks up the pen, writing for the first time about his remarkable life and those he has shared it with. In his unique voice, Bono takes us from his early days growing up in Dublin, including the sudden loss of his mother when he was fourteen, to U2\u2019s unlikely journey to become one of the world\u2019s most influential rock bands, to his more than twenty years of activism dedicated to the fight against AIDS and extreme poverty.

Jim took the job because he felt he couldn\u2019t refuse. But that year turned into his life\u2019s calling. Tracy Kidder spent five years following Dr. O\u2019Connell and his colleagues as they served their thousands of homeless patients. In this illuminating book we travel with O\u2019Connell as he navigates the city, offering medical care, socks, soup, empathy, humor, and friendship to some of the city\u2019s most endangered citizens. He emphasizes a style of medicine in which patients come first, joined with their providers in what he calls \u201ca system of friends.\u201d Much as he did with Paul Farmer in Mountains Beyond Mountains, Kidder explores how a small but dedicated group of people have changed countless lives by facing one of American society\u2019s difficult problems instead of looking away."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 9, "weeks_on_list": 13, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593133234", "primary_isbn13": "9780593133231", "publisher": "Random House", "description": "The Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning science writer explains the sensory perceptions and ways of communication used by a variety of animals.", "price": "0.00", "title": "An Immense World", "author": "Ed Yong", "contributor": "by Ed Yong", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593133231.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593133234?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593133234", "isbn13": "9780593133231"}, {"isbn10": "0593133242", "isbn13": "9780593133248"}, {"isbn10": "0593593545", "isbn13": "9780593593547"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593133234?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593133231?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593133231"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FAN%2BIMMENSE%2BWORLD%2FEd%2BYong%2F9780593133231"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593133231"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593133231?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/ce082838-bf4a-5a13-8b8b-f7e2f3589d0a", "list_date": "2023/02/05", "published_data": "2022-06-21", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 A \u201cthrilling\u201d (The New York Times), \u201cdazzling\u201d (The Wall Street Journal) tour of the radically different ways that animals perceive the world that will fill you with wonder and forever alter your perspective, by Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning science journalist Ed Yong \u201cOne of this year\u2019s finest works of narrative nonfiction.\u201d\u2014Oprah Daily ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Time, People, The Philadelphia Inquirer, Slate, Reader\u2019s Digest, Outside, Publishers Weekly, BookPage ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: Oprah Daily, The New Yorker, The Washington Post, The Guardian, Smithsonian Magazine, Prospect (UK), Mental Floss, She Reads, Kirkus Reviews, Library Journal The Earth teems with sights and textures, sounds and vibrations, smells and tastes, electric and magnetic fields. But every kind of animal, including humans, is enclosed within its own unique sensory bubble, perceiving but a tiny sliver of our immense world. In An Immense World, Ed Yong coaxes us beyond the confines of our own senses, allowing us to perceive the skeins of scent, waves of electromagnetism, and pulses of pressure that surround us. We encounter beetles that are drawn to fires, turtles that can track the Earth\u2019s magnetic fields, fish that fill rivers with electrical messages, and even humans who wield sonar like bats. We discover that a crocodile\u2019s scaly face is as sensitive as a lover\u2019s fingertips, that the eyes of a giant squid evolved to see sparkling whales, that plants thrum with the inaudible songs of courting bugs, and that even simple scallops have complex vision. We learn what bees see in flowers, what songbirds hear in their tunes, and what dogs smell on the street. We listen to stories of pivotal discoveries in the field, while looking ahead at the many mysteries that remain unsolved.

A singular figure at a singular moment, Adams amplified the Boston Massacre. He helped to mastermind the Boston Tea Party. He employed every tool available to rally a town, a colony, and eventually a band of colonies behind him, creating the cause that created a country.

One of the most decorated collegiate athletes of all time and a national champion as a pro, she was a major face of women\u2019s running for Nike before leaving to shake up the industry with feminist running brand Oiselle and now coaches elite young female runners. Every step of the way, she has seen the way that our sports systems\u2014originally designed by men, for men and boys\u2014fail young women and girls as much as empower them. Girls drop out of sports at alarming rates once they hit puberty, and female collegiate athletes routinely fall victim to injury, eating disorders, or mental health struggles as they try to force their way past a natural dip in performance for women of their age. Part memoir, part manifesto, Good for a Girl is Fleshman\u2019s story of falling in love with running as a girl, being pushed to her limits and succumbing to devastating injuries, and daring to fight for a better way for female athletes. Long gone are the days when women and girls felt lucky just to participate; Fleshman and women everywhere are waking up to the reality that they\u2019re running, playing, and competing in a world that wasn\u2019t made for them. Drawing on not only her own story but also emerging research on the physiology and psychology of young athletes, of any gender, Fleshman gives voice to the often-silent experience of the female athlete and argues that the time has come to rebuild our systems of competitive sport with women at their center.

This official edition of the House Report breaks ground with new evidence, analysis, and primary sources, including quotes from newly released interviews. Only the entire, authoritative report--now a historical document--can capture the full range of plots that have been exposed over time, from the violent attack on January 6 to related efforts revealed months after the insurrection. This is the only edition featuring an additional, independent, and newly reported foreword by a journalist and attorney with a front row seat to the committee's work, MSNBC anchor Ari Melber. The Emmy-Award winning reporter has interviewed key players from members of the Committee to planners of the Jan. 6 rally (now cooperating witnesses) to Trump White House aide Peter Navarro (now indicted for defying the probe). Melber's contribution reveals that former President Trump's plots comprised a continuous coup conspiracy, rather than planning for a \"single day.\" He exposes how that effort ranged from lawsuits to elector fraud to blatantly illegal efforts to overturn votes. In chilling detail, he shows how that process might have engineered a technical effort to \"override\" the election on the floor of Congress--an essential map, and warning, for those who wish to protect democracy. If the warnings are ignored, the failed coup may become a rehearsal. This report is not only a vital document in modern American history, it can also inform efforts to protect the future of American democracy. As a matter of justice, bipartisanship, and even patriotism, this report may very well become essential reading for people intent on facing the next potential coup with a commitment to facts, accountability, and democracy."}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1541601394", "primary_isbn13": "9781541601390", "publisher": "Basic", "description": "A collection of essays by historians who separate fact from fiction as they detail our nation\u2019s past.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Myth America", "author": "edited  Kevin M.

Dylan, who began working on the book in 2010, offers a master class on the art and craft of songwriting. He writes over sixty essays focusing on songs by other artists, spanning from Stephen Foster to Elvis Costello, and in between ranging from Hank Williams to Nina Simone. He analyzes what he calls the trap of easy rhymes, breaks down how the addition of a single syllable can diminish a song, and even explains how bluegrass relates to heavy metal. These essays are written in Dylan\u2019s unique prose. They are mysterious and mercurial, poignant and profound, and often laugh-out-loud funny. And while they are ostensibly about music, they are really meditations and reflections on the human condition. Running throughout the book are nearly 150 carefully curated photos as well as a series of dream-like riffs that, taken together, resemble an epic poem and add to the work\u2019s transcendence. In 2020, with the release of his outstanding album Rough and Rowdy Ways, Dylan became the first artist to have an album hit the Billboard Top 40 in each decade since the 1960s. The Philosophy of Modern Song contains much of what he has learned about his craft in all those years, and like everything that Dylan does, it is a momentous artistic achievement."}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 12, "weeks_on_list": 5, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1668001845", "primary_isbn13": "9781668001844", "publisher": "Threshold Editions", "description": "A collection of the late conservative commentator\u2019s on-air moments, with memories from his widow and brother.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Radio'S Greatest Of All Time", "author": "Rush Limbaugh with Kathryn Adams Limbaugh and David Limbaugh", "contributor": "by Rush Limbaugh with Kathryn Adams Limbaugh and David Limbaugh", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781668001844.jpg", "book_image_width": 400, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1668001845?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1668001845", "isbn13": "9781668001844"}, {"isbn10": "1668001861", "isbn13": "9781668001868"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1668001845?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781668001844?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781668001844"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FRADIO%2527S%2BGREATEST%2BOF%2BALL%2BTIME%2FRush%2BLimbaugh%2Bwith%2BKathryn%2BAdams%2BLimbaugh%2Band%2BDavid%2BLimbaugh%2F9781668001844"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781668001844"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781668001844?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/91a96935-a717-594d-ace2-a35fcd74314f", "list_date": "2023/01/08", "published_data": "2022-10-25", "summary": "A collection of Limbaugh's radio programs, including anecdotes; interview, and speech transcripts.

Now he shares his story for the first time in \u201ca wonderful addition to a seminal career\u201d (San Francisco Chronicle), \u201cinfused with nostalgia and his signature hilarity\u201d (Parade). ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: New York Post \u2022 \u201cLaugh-out-loud hilarious and always fascinating, from the great Mel Brooks. What else do you expect from the man who knew Jesus and dated Joan of Arc?\u201d\u2014Billy Crystal For anyone who loves American comedy, the long wait is over. Here are the never-before-told, behind-the-scenes anecdotes and remembrances from a master storyteller, filmmaker, and creator of all things funny. All About Me! charts Mel Brooks\u2019s meteoric rise from a Depression-era kid in Brooklyn to the recipient of the National Medal of Arts. Whether serving in the United States Army in World War II, or during his burgeoning career as a teenage comedian in the Catskills, Mel was always mining his experiences for material, always looking for the perfect joke. His iconic career began with Sid Caesar\u2019s Your Show of Shows, where he was part of the greatest writers\u2019 room in history, which included Carl Reiner, Neil Simon, and Larry Gelbart. After co-creating both the mega-hit 2000 Year Old Man comedy albums and the classic television series Get Smart, Brooks\u2019s stellar film career took off. He would go on to write, direct, and star in The Producers, The Twelve Chairs, Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, Silent Movie, High Anxiety, and Spaceballs, as well as produce groundbreaking and eclectic films, including The Elephant Man, The Fly, and My Favorite Year.

In 2016, Rob Delaney's one-year-old son, Henry, was diagnosed with a brain tumor. The family had moved from Los Angeles to London with their two young boys when Rob's wife was pregnant with Henry, their third. The move was an adventure that would bind them even more tightly together as they navigated the novelty of London, the culture clashes, and the funhouse experience of Rob's fame--thanks to his role as co-creator and co-star of the hit series Catastrophe. Henry's illness was a cataclysm that changed everything about their lives. Amid the hospital routine, surgeries, and brutal treatments, they found a newfound community of nurses, aides, caregivers, and fellow parents contending with the unthinkable. Two years later, Henry died, and his family watched their world fall away to reveal the things that matter most. A Heart That Works is Delaney's intimate, unflinching, and fiercely funny exploration of what happened - from the harrowing illness to the vivid, bodily impact of grief and the blind, furious rage that followed, through to the forceful, unstoppable love that remains. In the madness of his grief, Delaney grapples with the fragile miracle of life, the mysteries of death, and the question of purpose for those left behind. Delaney's memoir--profound, painful, full of emotion, and bracingly honest--offers solace to those who have faced devastation and shows us how grace may appear even in the darkest times."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 7, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "198211276X", "primary_isbn13": "9781982112769", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "description": "Behind-the-scenes photos and stories of the streaming series about the art of comedy.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee Book", "author": "Jerry Seinfeld", "contributor": "by Jerry Seinfeld", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781982112769.jpg", "book_image_width": 393, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/198211276X?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "198211276X", "isbn13": "9781982112769"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/198211276X?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781982112769?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781982112769"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BCOMEDIANS%2BIN%2BCARS%2BGETTING%2BCOFFEE%2BBOOK%2FJerry%2BSeinfeld%2F9781982112769"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781982112769"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781982112769?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/9a16a6ac-2ab7-5d19-8d41-ffc73922aa71", "list_date": "2022/12/18", "published_data": "2022-11-22", "summary": "A celebration of and behind-the-scenes look at Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s groundbreaking streaming series Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.

Painfully shy, Elizabeth Windsor's personality was well suited to her youthful ambition of living quietly in the country, raising a family, and caring for her dogs and horses. But when her uncle, King Edward VIII, abdicated, she became heir to the throne--embarking on a journey that would test her as a woman and as a queen. Ascending to the throne at only 25, this self-effacing monarch navigated endless setbacks, family conflict, and occasional triumphs throughout her 70 years as the Queen of England. As her mettle was tested, she endeavored to keep the monarchy relevant culturally, socially, and politically, often in the face of resistance from inside the institution itself. And yet the greatest challenges she faced were often inside her own family, forever under intense scrutiny; from rumors about her husband's infidelity, her sister's marital breakdown, Princess Diana's tragic death, to the recent departure of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. Now in The Queen, renowned biographer Andrew Morton takes an in-depth look at Britain's longest reigning monarch, exploring the influence Queen Elizabeth has had on both Britain and the rest of the world for much of the last century. From leading a nation struggling to restore itself after the devastation of the second World War to navigating the divisive political landscape of the present day, Queen Elizabeth has been a reluctant but resolute queen. This is the story of a woman of unflagging self-discipline who will long be remembered as mother and grandmother to Great Britain, and one of the greatest sovereigns of the modern era."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1668008440", "primary_isbn13": "9781668008447", "publisher": "Threshold Editions", "description": "An autobiography by the former prime minister of Israel.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Bibi", "author": "Benjamin Netanyahu", "contributor": "by Benjamin Netanyahu", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781668008447.jpg", "book_image_width": 336, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1668008440?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1668008440", "isbn13": "9781668008447"}, {"isbn10": "1668008467", "isbn13": "9781668008461"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1668008440?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781668008447?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781668008447"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FBIBI%2FBenjamin%2BNetanyahu%2F9781668008447"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781668008447"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781668008447?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/ec20e323-6a5c-57ef-8861-581113a7e3d2", "list_date": "2022/12/11", "published_data": "2022-10-18", "summary": "In Benjamin \"Bibi\" Netanyahu's sweeping, moving autobiography, one of the most formidable and insightful leaders of our time tells the story of his family, his path to leadership, and his unceasing commitment to defending Israel and securing its future."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593355423", "primary_isbn13": "9780593355428", "publisher": "Ballantine", "description": "Observations and anecdotes from a star of \"Gilmore Girls.\"", "price": "0.00", "title": "Have I Told You This Already?", "author": "Lauren Graham", "contributor": "by Lauren Graham", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593355428.jpg", "book_image_width": 333, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593355423?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593355423", "isbn13": "9780593355428"}, {"isbn10": "0593355431", "isbn13": "9780593355435"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593355423?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593355428?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593355428"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FHAVE%2BI%2BTOLD%2BYOU%2BTHIS%2BALREADY%253F%2FLauren%2BGraham%2F9780593355428"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593355428"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593355428?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/b9542f58-ffbc-5bff-97a0-fa91a0037d68", "list_date": "2022/12/04", "published_data": "2022-11-15", "summary": "From the beloved star of Gilmore Girls and the New York Times bestselling author of Talking as Fast as I Can comes a candid, insightful, and wildly entertaining essay collection. \u201cFast, furious, smart, and ridiculously funny.\u201d\u2014Amy Sherman-Palladino, creator of Gilmore Girls, Bunheads, and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel Lauren Graham has graced countless television screens with her quick-witted characters and hilarious talk show appearances, earning a reputation as a pop culture icon who always has something to say.

Trump's presidency like no other journalist, Confidence Man is a magnificent and disturbing reckoning that chronicles his life and its meaning from his rise in New York City to his tortured post-presidency. Few journalists working today have covered Donald Trump more extensively than Maggie Haberman. And few understand him and his motivations better. Now, demonstrating her majestic command of this story, Haberman reveals in full the depth of her understanding of the 45th president himself, and of what the Trump phenomenon means. Interviews with hundreds of sources and numerous interviews over the years with Trump himself portray a complicated and often contradictory historical figure. Capable of kindness but relying on casual cruelty as it suits his purposes. Pugnacious. Insecure. Lonely. Vindictive. Menacing. Smarter than his critics contend and colder and more calculating than his allies believe. A man who embedded himself in popular culture, galvanizing support for a run for high office that he began preliminary spadework for 30 years ago, to ultimately become a president who pushed American democracy to the brink. The through-line of Trump\u2019s life and his presidency is the enduring question of what is in it for him or what he needs to say to survive short increments of time in the pursuit of his own interests. Confidence Man is also, inevitably, about the world that produced such a singular character, giving rise to his career and becoming his first stage. It is also about a series of relentlessly transactional relationships. The ones that shaped him most were with girlfriends and wives, with Roy Cohn, with George Steinbrenner, with Mike Tyson and Don King and Roger Stone, with city and state politicians like Robert Morgenthau and Rudy Giuliani, with business partners, with prosecutors, with the media, and with the employees who toiled inside what they commonly called amongst themselves the \u201cTrump Disorganization.\u201d That world informed the one that Trump tried to recreate while in the White House. All of Trump\u2019s behavior as President had echoes in what came before. In this revelatory and newsmaking book, Haberman brings together the events of his life into a single mesmerizing work. It is the definitive account of one of the most norms-shattering and consequential eras in American political history."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 12, "weeks_on_list": 4, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593534506", "primary_isbn13": "9780593534502", "publisher": "Knopf", "description": "The late movie star\u2019s memoir reveals intimate details about his personal relationships and professional rivalries; compiled and edited by David Rosenthal.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Extraordinary Life Of An Ordinary Man", "author": "Paul Newman", "contributor": "by Paul Newman", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593534502.jpg", "book_image_width": 342, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593534506?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593534506", "isbn13": "9780593534502"}, {"isbn10": "0593534514", "isbn13": "9780593534519"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593534506?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593534502?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593534502"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BEXTRAORDINARY%2BLIFE%2BOF%2BAN%2BORDINARY%2BMAN%2FPaul%2BNewman%2F9780593534502"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593534502"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593534502?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/bc97d701-28db-5f75-81e1-b54d5f704973", "list_date": "2022/11/27", "published_data": "2022-10-18", "summary": "The raw, candid, unvarnished memoir of an American icon. The greatest movie star of the past 75 years covers everything: his traumatic childhood, his career, his drinking, his thoughts on Marlon Brando, James Dean, Elizabeth Taylor, John Huston, his greatest roles, acting, his intimate life with Joanne Woodward, his innermost fears and passions and joys. With thoughts/comments throughout from Joanne Woodward, George Roy Hill, Tom Cruise, Elia Kazan and many others. In 1986, Paul Newman and his closest friend, screenwriter Stewart Stern, began an extraordinary project. Stuart was to compile an oral history, to have Newman\u2019s family and friends and those who worked closely with him, talk about the actor\u2019s life. And then Newman would work with Stewart and give his side of the story. The only stipulation was that anyone who spoke on the record had to be completely honest. That same stipulation applied to Newman himself. The project lasted five years. The result is an extraordinary memoir, culled from thousands of pages of transcripts. The book is insightful, revealing, surprising. Newman\u2019s voice is powerful, sometimes funny, sometimes painful, always meeting that high standard of searing honesty. The additional voices\u2014from childhood friends and Navy buddies, from family members and film and theater collaborators such as Tom Cruise, George Roy Hill, Martin Ritt, and John Huston\u2014that run throughout add richness and color and context to the story Newman is telling. Newman\u2019s often traumatic childhood is brilliantly detailed. He talks about his teenage insecurities, his early failures with women, his rise to stardom, his early rivals (Marlon Brando and James Dean), his first marriage, his drinking, his philanthropy, the death of his son Scott, his strong desire for his daughters to know and understand the truth about their father. Perhaps the most moving material in the book centers around his relationship with Joanne Woodward\u2014their love for each other, his dependence on her, the way she shaped him intellectually, emotionally and sexually. The Extraordinary Life of an Ordinary Man is revelatory and introspective, personal and analytical, loving and tender in some places, always complex and profound."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 5, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1982188081", "primary_isbn13": "9781982188085", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "description": "The NPR legal affairs correspondent details her professional accomplishments and friendship with the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Dinners With Ruth", "author": "Nina Totenberg", "contributor": "by Nina Totenberg", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781982188085.jpg", "book_image_width": 326, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982188081?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1982188081", "isbn13": "9781982188085"}, {"isbn10": "1982188103", "isbn13": "9781982188108"}, {"isbn10": "1797147242", "isbn13": "9781797147246"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982188081?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781982188085?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781982188085"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FDINNERS%2BWITH%2BRUTH%2FNina%2BTotenberg%2F9781982188085"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781982188085"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781982188085?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/df57b0f7-e75f-5762-b0bb-b7a9fe2d6db2", "list_date": "2022/11/27", "published_data": "2022-09-13", "summary": "NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg examines her life, career, and female colleagues and relatives, focusing on her 50-year friendship with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg."}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 8, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1684513618", "primary_isbn13": "9781684513611", "publisher": "Regnery", "description": "The Republican senator from Texas gives his take on the justice system.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Justice Corrupted", "author": "Ted Cruz", "contributor": "by Ted Cruz", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781684513611.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1684513618?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1684513618", "isbn13": "9781684513611"}, {"isbn10": "1684513693", "isbn13": "9781684513697"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1684513618?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781684513611?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781684513611"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FJUSTICE%2BCORRUPTED%2FTed%2BCruz%2F9781684513611"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781684513611"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781684513611?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/ffbaf1e2-92f7-5cde-b65c-3f5a5f6cff04", "list_date": "2022/11/20", "published_data": "2022-09-13", "summary": ". . . with liberty and justice for some.

It was love at first sight when actress Tembi met professional chef, Saro, on a street in Florence. There was just one problem: Saro\u2019s traditional Sicilian family did not approve of his marrying a black American woman. However, the couple, heartbroken but undeterred, forged on. They built a happy life in Los Angeles, with fulfilling careers, deep friendships, and the love of their lives: a baby girl they adopted at birth. Eventually, they reconciled with Saro\u2019s family just as he faced a formidable cancer that would consume all their dreams. From Scratch chronicles three summers Tembi spends in Sicily with her daughter, Zoela, as she begins to piece together a life without her husband in his tiny hometown hamlet of farmers. Where once Tembi was estranged from Saro\u2019s family, now she finds solace and nourishment\u2014literally and spiritually\u2014at her mother-in-law\u2019s table.

Reich, best-selling author of The System The lifeblood of any free society is persuasion: changing other people\u2019s minds in order to change things. But America is suffering a crisis of faith in persuasion that is putting its democracy and the planet itself at risk. Americans increasingly write one another off instead of seeking to win one another over. Debates are framed in moralistic terms, with enemies battling the righteous. Movements for justice build barriers to entry, instead of on-ramps. Political parties focus on mobilizing the faithful rather than wooing the skeptical. And leaders who seek to forge coalitions are labeled sellouts. In The Persuaders, Anand Giridharadas takes us inside these movements and battles, seeking out the dissenters who continue to champion persuasion in an age of polarization. We meet a leader of Black Lives Matter; a trailblazer in the feminist resistance to Trumpism; white parents at a seminar on raising adopted children of color; Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; a team of door knockers with an uncanny formula for changing minds on immigration; an ex-cult member turned QAnon deprogrammer; and, hovering menacingly offstage, Russian operatives clandestinely stoking Americans\u2019 fatalism about one another.

Anthony Bourdain's death by suicide in June, 2018 shocked people around the world. Bourdain seemed to have it all: an irresistible personality, a dream job, a beautiful family, and international fame. The reality, though, was more complicated than it seemed. Bourdain became a celebrity with his bestselling book Kitchen Confidential. He parlayed it into a series of hit television shows, including the Food Channel's Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations and CNN's Parts Unknown. But his charisma belied a troubled spirit. Addiction and an obsession with perfection and personal integrity ruined two marriages and turned him into a boss from hell, even as millions became intrigued by the ever-curious and genuinely empathetic traveler they saw on TV. Bourdain was already running out of steam, physically and emotionally, when he fell hard for an Italian actress who could be even colder to him than he sometimes was to others, and who effectively drove a wedge between him and his young daughter. Down and Out in Paradise is the first book to tell the true and full Bourdain story, relating the highs and lows of an extraordinary life. Leerhsen shows how Bourdain's never-before-reported childhood traumas fueled both his creativity and the insecurities that would lead him to a place of despair."}, {"rank": 7, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1668007193", "primary_isbn13": "9781668007198", "publisher": "Atria", "description": "The veteran police officer and former Trump supporter describes his experiences during the Jan. 6 insurrection and their impact on him.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Hold The Line", "author": "Michael Fanone and John Shiffman", "contributor": "by Michael Fanone and John Shiffman", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781668007198.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1668007193?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1668007193", "isbn13": "9781668007198"}, {"isbn10": "1668007231", "isbn13": "9781668007235"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1668007193?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781668007198?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781668007198"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FHOLD%2BTHE%2BLINE%2FMichael%2BFanone%2Band%2BJohn%2BShiffman%2F9781668007198"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781668007198"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781668007198?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/c047832b-ea81-5f82-a49b-0b80a2ec3638", "list_date": "2022/10/30", "published_data": "2022-10-11", "summary": "INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER An urgent warning about the growing threat to our democracy from a twenty-year police veteran and former Trump supporter who nearly lost his life during the insurrection of January 6th.

In a story now being echoed in recent breaking news stories about IRS persecution of Trump foes such as former FBI head James Comey and others, Cohen details \u2014 in his inimitable blunt language, with absolutely no holds barred and naming names \u2014 his attempt to clear his name and tell the truth about Donald Trump. Chillingly, he also makes clear what happens when you try to speak truth to power, and the power knows no bounds."}, {"rank": 9, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593418360", "primary_isbn13": "9780593418369", "publisher": "Riverhead", "description": "The author of \u201cThinking in Pictures\u201d gives insights into visual thinking.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Visual Thinking", "author": "Temple Grandin with Betsy Lerner", "contributor": "by Temple Grandin with Betsy Lerner", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593418369.jpg", "book_image_width": 333, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593418360?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593418360", "isbn13": "9780593418369"}, {"isbn10": "0593418387", "isbn13": "9780593418383"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593418360?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593418369?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593418369"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FVISUAL%2BTHINKING%2FTemple%2BGrandin%2Bwith%2BBetsy%2BLerner%2F9780593418369"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593418369"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593418369?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/af640063-b16b-5f00-8416-45a7c1cee435", "list_date": "2022/10/30", "published_data": "2022-10-11", "summary": "INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u201cA powerful and provocative testament to the diverse coalition of minds we\u2019ll need to face the mounting challenges of the twenty-first century.\u201d \u2014Steve Silberman \u201cAn absolute eye-opener.\u201d \u2014Frans de Waal A landmark book that reveals, celebrates, and advocates for the special minds and contributions of visual thinkers A quarter of a century after her memoir, Thinking in Pictures, forever changed how the world understood autism, Temple Grandin\u2014the \u201canthropologist on Mars,\u201d as Oliver Sacks dubbed her\u2014transforms our awareness of the different ways our brains are wired.

Visual thinkers constitute a far greater proportion of the population than previously believed, she reveals, and a more varied one, from the photo-realistic object visualizers like Grandin herself, with their intuitive knack for design and problem solving, to the abstract, mathematically inclined \u201cvisual spatial\u201d thinkers who excel in pattern recognition and systemic thinking. She also makes us understand how a world increasingly geared to the verbal tends to sideline visual thinkers, screening them out at school and passing over them in the workplace.

Frankly, it turned into a version of therapy I hadn't realized I'd needed and couldn't have known how much I'd enjoy.\" --Jim Parsons The definitive, behind-the-scenes look at the most popular sitcom of the last decade, The Big Bang Theory, packed with all-new, exclusive interviews with the producers and entire cast. The Big Bang Theory is a television phenomenon. To the casual viewer, it's a seemingly effortless comedy, with relatable characters tackling real-life issues, offering a kind of visual comfort food to its millions of dedicated fans. But the behind-the-scenes journey of the show from a failed pilot to a global sensation is a fascinating story that even the most die-hard fans don't know in its entirety. THE BIG BANG THEORY: THE DEFINITIVE, INSIDE STORY OF THE EPIC HIT SERIES is a riveting, entertaining look at the sitcom sensation, with the blessing and participation of co-creators Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, executive producers Steve Molaro and Steve Holland, as well as Johnny Galecki, Jim Parsons, Kaley Cuoco, Simon Helberg, Kunal Nayyar, Melissa Rauch, Mayim Bialik, and more. Glamour senior editor Jessica Radloff, who has written over 150 articles on the series (and even had a cameo in the finale!), gives readers an all-access pass to its intrepid producing and writing team and beloved cast. It's a story of on-and-off screen romance told in hilarious and emotional detail, of casting choices that nearly changed everything (which even some of the actors didn't know until now), of cast members bravely powering through personal tragedies, and when it came time to announce the 12th season would be its last, the complicated reasons why it was more difficult than anyone ever led on. Through hundreds of hours of interviews with the sitcom's major players, Radloff dives into all this and much more. The book is the ultimate celebration of this once-in-a-generation show and a must-have for all fans."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 6, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593542401", "primary_isbn13": "9780593542408", "publisher": "Portfolio", "description": "An overview of events from 1945 to the present and how they might inform potential crises in the near future.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Adrift", "author": "Scott Galloway", "contributor": "by Scott Galloway", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593542408.jpg", "book_image_width": 380, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593542401?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593542401", "isbn13": "9780593542408"}, {"isbn10": "059354241X", "isbn13": "9780593542415"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593542401?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593542408?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593542408"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FADRIFT%2FScott%2BGalloway%2F9780593542408"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593542408"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593542408?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/e76b7bd2-d97a-5388-adbc-d9ffe1867064", "list_date": "2022/10/30", "published_data": "2022-09-27", "summary": "From bestselling author and NYU business school professor Scott Galloway comes an urgent examination of the future of our nation \u2013 and how we got here. We are only just beginning to reckon with our post-pandemic future. As political extremism intensifies, the great resignation affects businesses everywhere, and supply chain issues crush bottom lines, we\u2019re faced with daunting questions \u2013 is our democracy under threat? How will Big Tech change our lives? What does job security look like for me? America is on the brink of massive change \u2013 change that will disrupt the workings of our economy and drastically impact the financial backbone of our nation: the middle class. In Adrift, Galloway looks to the past \u2013 from 1945 to present day \u2013 to explain just how America arrived at this precipice. Telling the story of our nation through 100 charts, Galloway demonstrates how crises such as Jim Crow, World War II, and the Stock Market Crash of 2008, as well as the escalating power of technology, an entrenched white patriarchy, and the socio-economic effects of the pandemic, created today\u2019s perfect storm. Adrift attempts to make sense of it all, and offers Galloway\u2019s unique take on where we\u2019re headed and who we\u2019ll become, touching on topics as wide-ranging as online dating to minimum wage to the American dream. Just as in 1945 and 1980, America is once again a nation at a crossroads.

McKinsey's vaunted statement of values asserts that its role is to make the world a better place, and its reputation for excellence and discretion attracts top talent from universities around the world. But what does it actually do? In When McKinsey Comes to Town, two prizewinning investigative journalists have written a portrait of the company sharply at odds with its public image. Often McKinsey's advice boils down to major cost-cutting, including layoffs and maintenance reductions, to drive up short-term profits, thereby boosting a company's stock price and the wealth of its executives who hire it, at the expense of workers and safety measures. McKinsey collects millions of dollars advising government agencies that also regulate McKinsey's corporate clients. And the firm frequently advises competitors in the same industries, but denies that this presents any conflict of interest. In one telling example, McKinsey advised a Chinese engineering company allied with the communist government which constructed artificial islands, now used as staging grounds for the Chinese Navy\u2014while at the same time taking tens of millions of dollars from the Pentagon, whose chief aim is to counter Chinese aggression. Shielded by NDAs, McKinsey has escaped public scrutiny despite its role in advising tobacco and vaping companies, purveyors of opioids, repressive governments, and oil companies. McKinsey helped insurance companies' boost their profits by making it incredibly difficult for accident victims to get payments; worked its U.S. government contacts to let Wall Street firms evade scrutiny; enabled corruption in developing countries such as South Africa; undermined health-care programs in states across the country.

When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, college football was at the height of its popularity. As the nation geared up for total war, one branch of the service dominated the aspirations of college football stars: the United States Marine Corps. Which is why, on Christmas Eve of 1944, when the 4th and 29th Marine regiments found themselves in the middle of the Pacific Ocean training for what would be the bloodiest battle of the war - the invasion of Okinawa--their ranks included one of the greatest pools of football talent ever assembled: Former All Americans, captains from Wisconsin and Brown and Notre Dame, and nearly twenty men who were either drafted or would ultimately play in the NFL. When the trash-talking between the 4th and 29th over who had the better football team reached a fever pitch, it was decided: The two regiments would play each other in a football game as close to the real thing as you could get in the dirt and coral of Guadalcanal. The bruising and bloody game that followed became known as \"The Mosquito Bowl.\" Within a matter of months, fifteen of the 64 the players in \"The Mosquito Bowl\" would be killed at Okinawa, by far the largest number of American athletes ever to die in a single battle. The Mosquito Bowl is the story of these brave and beautiful young men, those who survived and those who did not. It is the story of the families and the landscape that shaped them. It is a story of a far more innocent time in both college athletics and the life of the country, and of the loss of that innocence. Writing with the style and rigor that won him a Pulitzer Prize and have made several of his books modern classics, Buzz Bissinger takes us from the playing fields of America's campuses where boys played at being Marines, to the final time they were allowed to still be boys on that field of dirt and coral, to the darkest and deadliest days that followed at Okinawa."}, {"rank": 9, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1250866766", "primary_isbn13": "9781250866769", "publisher": "Holt", "description": "The former House Republican shares his insights on the Jan. 6 Select Committee\u2019s investigation and details about the Trump White House.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Breach", "author": "Denver Riggleman with Hunter Walker", "contributor": "by Denver Riggleman with Hunter Walker", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781250866769.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250866766?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1250866766", "isbn13": "9781250866769"}, {"isbn10": "1250866774", "isbn13": "9781250866776"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250866766?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781250866769?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781250866769"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BBREACH%2FDenver%2BRiggleman%2Bwith%2BHunter%2BWalker%2F9781250866769"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781250866769"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250866769?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/1ed17158-13c1-5e30-8254-979b7e4e94af", "list_date": "2022/10/16", "published_data": "2022-09-27", "summary": "\"As the US capital was attacked on January 6, 2021, the White House went dark for seven hours and thirty-seven minutes.

It tells the tale of how the Republican Party has turned into a conspiracy cult, kicking ideology and policy principles to the curb in support of a president who embraced and exploited-and stirred-the most bizarre and craziest extremism of the right. The Trump-incited insurrectionist attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, was no aberration. AMERICAN PSYCHOSIS reveals it was a continuation of a long and deep-rooted tradition within the party, the result of a derangement on the right that has been accepted and often nurtured by the GOP. AMERICAN PSYCHOSIS entertains and enlightens even as it horrifies, and will be a crucial part of the roiling conversation under way in the run-up to the first post-Trump election. The story told in AMERICAN PSYCHOSIS covers the last half-century; from McCarthyism to the Birchers to segregationists to the religious right to the militia movement to Rush Limbaugh to the tea party and to Donald Trump, the Republican Party has encouraged and exploited rightwing fear and loathing that has been dangerously fueled by conspiracy theories, and now holds the entire United States political process in its grip."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 14, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1668003880", "primary_isbn13": "9781668003886", "publisher": "Avid Reader", "description": "The creator of \u201cThe Borowitz Report\u201d looks at the declining knowledge of some public officials over the last 50 years.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Profiles In Ignorance", "author": "Andy Borowitz", "contributor": "by Andy Borowitz", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781668003886.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1668003880?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1668003880", "isbn13": "9781668003886"}, {"isbn10": "1668003902", "isbn13": "9781668003909"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1668003880?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781668003886?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781668003886"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FPROFILES%2BIN%2BIGNORANCE%2FAndy%2BBorowitz%2F9781668003886"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781668003886"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781668003886?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/7cb5ae0c-38e0-5861-a4f7-beb51af143bd", "list_date": "2022/10/16", "published_data": "2022-09-13", "summary": "Named One of 7 Best Nonfiction Books of the Fall by Kirkus Reviews Andy Borowitz, \u201cone of the funniest people in America\u201d (CBS Sunday Morning), brilliantly examines the intellectual deterioration of American politics, from Ronald Reagan to Dan Quayle, from George W. Bush to Sarah Palin, to its apotheosis in Donald J. Trump. The winner of the first-ever National Press Club award for humor, Andy Borowitz has been called a \u201cSwiftian satirist\u201d (The Wall Street Journal) and \u201cone of the country\u2019s finest satirists\u201d (The New York Times). Millions of fans and New Yorker readers enjoy his satirical news column \u201cThe Borowitz Report.\u201d Now, in Profiles in Ignorance, he offers a witty, spot-on diagnosis of our country\u2019s political troubles by showing how ignorant leaders are degrading, embarrassing, and endangering our nation. Borowitz argues that over the past fifty years, American politicians have grown increasingly allergic to knowledge, and mass media have encouraged the election of ignoramuses by elevating candidates who are better at performing than thinking. Starting with Ronald Reagan\u2019s first campaign for governor of California in 1966 and culminating with the election of Donald J. Trump to the White House, Borowitz shows how, during the age of twenty-four-hour news and social media, the US has elected politicians to positions of great power whose lack of the most basic information is terrifying. In addition to Reagan, Quayle, Bush, Palin, and Trump, Borowitz covers a host of congresspersons, senators, and governors who have helped lower the bar over the past five decades. Profiles in Ignorance aims to make us both laugh and cry: laugh at the idiotic antics of these public figures, and cry at the cataclysms these icons of ignorance have caused. But most importantly, the book delivers a call to action and a cause for optimism: History doesn\u2019t move in a straight line, and we can change course if we act now."}, {"rank": 9, "rank_last_week": 11, "weeks_on_list": 5, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0063221489", "primary_isbn13": "9780063221482", "publisher": "Broadside", "description": "An account of time spent in the Trump White House by the former president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Breaking History", "author": "Jared Kushner", "contributor": "by Jared Kushner", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780063221482.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063221489?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0063221489", "isbn13": "9780063221482"}, {"isbn10": "0063221500", "isbn13": "9780063221505"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063221489?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780063221482?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780063221482"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FBREAKING%2BHISTORY%2FJared%2BKushner%2F9780063221482"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780063221482"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780063221482?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/e5ec4777-5f2f-5622-9288-9b1d96e8fe1d", "list_date": "2022/10/09", "published_data": "2022-08-03", "summary": "Jared Kushner was one of the most consequential presidential advisers in modern history. For the first time, he recounts what happened behind closed doors during the Trump presidency. Few White House advisors have had such an expansive portfolio or constant access to the president. From his office next to Trump, senior adviser Jared Kushner operated quietly behind the scenes, preferring to leave the turf wars and television sparring to others. Now, Kushner finally tells his story--a fast-paced and surprisingly candid account of how an earnest businessman with no political ambitions found himself pulled into a presidency that no one saw coming. Breaking History takes readers inside debates in the Oval Office, double-crosses at the United Nations, tense meetings in Arab palaces, high-stakes negotiations, and the daily barrage of leaks, false allegations, investigations, and West Wing infighting. A true historical thriller, this book is not your typical political memoir. Kushner details Washington's intense resistance to change and reveals how he broke through the stalemates of the past. An outsider among outsiders, Kushner was a results-driven executive among beltway power brokers. He questioned old assumptions and delivered unprecedented results on trade, criminal justice reform, production of COVID-19 vaccines, and Middle East peace. His successful negotiation of the Abraham Accords, the most significant diplomatic breakthrough in 50 years, earned him a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize. Written by one of the few people by Trump's side from his trip down the golden escalator to his final departure from Andrews Air Force Base, Breaking History provides the most honest, nuanced, and definitive understanding of a presidency that will be studied for generations."}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593186583", "primary_isbn13": "9780593186589", "publisher": "Dutton", "description": "The ways in which physics can be used to explain how some things function in the universe.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Biggest Ideas In The Universe", "author": "Sean Carroll", "contributor": "by Sean Carroll", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593186589.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593186583?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593186583", "isbn13": "9780593186589"}, {"isbn10": "0593186591", "isbn13": "9780593186596"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593186583?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593186589?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593186589"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BBIGGEST%2BIDEAS%2BIN%2BTHE%2BUNIVERSE%2FSean%2BCarroll%2F9780593186589"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593186589"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593186589?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/7ac64b6b-500a-5a90-9881-1a6a6651ec54", "list_date": "2022/10/09", "published_data": "2022-09-20", "summary": "INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u201cMost appealing... technical accuracy and lightness of tone...

Sean Carroll, with his genius for making complex notions entertaining, presents in his uniquely lucid voice the fundamental ideas informing the modern physics of reality. Physics offers deep insights into the workings of the universe but those insights come in the form of equations that often look like gobbledygook. Sean Carroll shows that they are really like meaningful poems that can help us fly over sierras to discover a miraculous multidimensional landscape alive with radiant giants, warped space-time, and bewilderingly powerful forces. High school calculus is itself a centuries-old marvel as worthy of our gaze as the Mona Lisa.

I walked this tightrope for two and a half years. Eventually, the rope snapped.\" - from Holding the Line \"A cautionary tale about how political forces can undermine the quest for justice.\" - Barbara McQuade, The Washington Post The gripping and explosive memoir of serving as US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, in the face of the Justice Department\u2019s attempts to protect Trump\u2019s friends and punish his enemies. Ascending to the leadership role of US Attorney for the Southern District, which includes Manhattan and several counties to the north, is a capstone to any legal career: it entails guiding a team of the best lawyers in America in selecting and winning cases that often have global import. Geoffrey Berman was honored to be tapped for the job by Donald Trump in 2018. The manner in which Trump had dispatched his predecessor Preet Bharara was troubling, but the institution was fabled for its independence. Surely he could manage. So began one of the most tumultuous two-and-a-half-year stretches in the over two-hundred-thirty year history of the office. Almost immediately, Berman found himself pushing back against the Trump Justice Department\u2019s blatant efforts to bring weak cases against political foes and squash worthy cases that threatened to tarnish allies and Trump himself. When Bill Barr became attorney general, Berman hoped and believed things would get better, but instead they got much worse. The heart of Holding the Line is his never-before-told account of the lengths Barr went to in corrupting the independence of the office, and the lengths Berman had to go in preserving it. Finally, Trump and Barr, fed up with Berman\u2019s principles, summarily fired him, though he refused to go quietly and prevented Barr from installing someone who might be more compliant. Berman\u2019s determined defense of the values of prosecutorial independence, without fear or favor, made him a hero to everyone who shares those values. Holding the Line also relates the remarkable casework of the Southern District in Berman\u2019s time there, including taking down notorious sex traffickers Jeffrey Epstein and Lawrence Ray, Big Pharma executives, and vicious criminal syndicates, and repatriating Nazi-looted art. Riveting in themselves, these stories showcase the esprit de corps that makes the Southern District so special, and the stakes Berman felt in protecting its integrity against all foes, up to and including the US attorney general and the president of the United States."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 7, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0316415197", "primary_isbn13": "9780316415194", "publisher": "Little, Brown", "description": "A memoir by the founder, co-editor and publisher of Rolling Stone magazine.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Like A Rolling Stone", "author": "Jann S.

It was clear he and his administration were going to pursue a series of retrograde, devastating policies. What could be done? Immediately, women lawyers all around the country, independently of each other, sprang into action, and they had a common goal: they weren\u2019t going to stand by in the face of injustice, while Trump, Mitch McConnell, and the Republican party did everything in their power to remake the judiciary in their own conservative image. Over the next four years, the women worked tirelessly to hold the line against the most chaotic and malign presidency in living memory. There was Sally Yates, the acting attorney general of the United States, who refused to sign off on the Muslim travel ban. And Becca Heller, the founder of a refugee assistance program who brought the fight over the travel ban to the airports. And Roberta Kaplan, the famed commercial litigator, who sued the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville. And, of course, Stacey Abrams, whose efforts to protect the voting rights of millions of Georgians may well have been what won the Senate for the Democrats in 2020. These are just a handful of the stories Lithwick dramatizes in thrilling detail to tell a brand-new and deeply inspiring account of the Trump years. With unparalleled access to her subjects, she has written a luminous book, not about the villains of the Trump years, but about the heroes. And as the country confronts the news that the Supreme Court, which includes three Trump-appointed justices, will soon overturn Roe v. Wade, Lithwick shines a light on not only the major consequences of such a decision, but issues a clarion call to all who might, like the women in this book, feel the urgency to join the fight. A celebration of the tireless efforts, legal ingenuity, and indefatigable spirit of the women whose work all too often went unrecognized at the time, Lady Justice is destined to be treasured and passed from hand to hand for generations to come, not just among lawyers and law students, but among all optimistic and hopeful Americans."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593136330", "primary_isbn13": "9780593136331", "publisher": "Crown", "description": "The author of \u201cThe Spy and the Traitor\u201d profiles Allied prisoners detained by the German Army in Colditz Castle during World War II.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Prisoners Of The Castle", "author": "Ben Macintyre", "contributor": "by Ben Macintyre", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593136331.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593136330?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593136330", "isbn13": "9780593136331"}, {"isbn10": "0593136349", "isbn13": "9780593136348"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593136330?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593136331?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593136331"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FPRISONERS%2BOF%2BTHE%2BCASTLE%2FBen%2BMacintyre%2F9780593136331"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593136331"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593136331?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/ea2b2001-6ee9-5d7f-b8ac-0d3eeb03bc49", "list_date": "2022/10/02", "published_data": "2022-09-13", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 The \u201centertaining yet objective and often-moving account\u201d (The Wall Street Journal) of one of history\u2019s most notorious prisons\u2014and the remarkable cast of POWs who tried relentlessly to escape their captors, from the author of The Spy and the Traitor \u201cNot since Ian Fleming and John le Carr\u00e9 has a spy writer so captivated readers.\u201d\u2014The Hollywood Reporter In this gripping narrative, Ben Macintyre tackles one of the most famous prison stories in history and makes it utterly his own. During World War II, the German army used the towering Colditz Castle to hold the most defiant Allied prisoners. For four years, these prisoners of the castle tested its walls and its guards with ingenious escape attempts that would become legend. But as Macintyre shows, the story of Colditz was about much more than escape. Its population represented a society in miniature, full of heroes and traitors, class conflicts and secret alliances, and the full range of human joy and despair. In Macintyre\u2019s telling, Colditz\u2019s most famous names\u2014like the indomitable Pat Reid\u2014share glory with lesser known but equally remarkable characters like Indian doctor Birendranath Mazumdar whose ill treatment, hunger strike, and eventual escape read like fiction; Florimond Duke, America\u2019s oldest paratrooper and least successful secret agent; and Christopher Clayton Hutton, the brilliant inventor employed by British intelligence to manufacture covert escape aids for POWs. Prisoners of the Castle traces the war\u2019s arc from within Colditz\u2019s stone walls, where the stakes rose as Hitler\u2019s war machine faltered and the men feared that liberation would not come soon enough to spare them a grisly fate at the hands of the Nazis.

Then came a great shift: invention sprinted forward, doubling our technological capabilities each generation and utterly transforming the economy again and again. Our ancestors would have presumed we would have used such powers to build utopia. But it was not so. When 1870\u00f72010 ended, the world instead saw global warming; economic depression, uncertainty, and inequality; and broad rejection of the status quo. Economist Brad DeLong's Slouching Towards Utopia tells the story of how this unprecedented explosion of material wealth occurred, how it transformed the globe--and why it failed to deliver us to utopia.

Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents\u2019 indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa\u2019s tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle. Born a Crime is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man\u2019s relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother\u2014his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life. The stories collected here are by turns hilarious, dramatic, and deeply affecting. Whether subsisting on caterpillars for dinner during hard times, being thrown from a moving car during an attempted kidnapping, or just trying to survive the life-and-death pitfalls of dating in high school, Trevor illuminates his curious world with an incisive wit and unflinching honesty. His stories weave together to form a moving and searingly funny portrait of a boy making his way through a damaged world in a dangerous time, armed only with a keen sense of humor and a mother\u2019s unconventional, unconditional love."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 9, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0063215047", "primary_isbn13": "9780063215047", "publisher": "Broadside", "description": "The \"Fox & Friends Weekend\" host makes his case for what he calls classical Christian education.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Battle For The American Mind", "author": "Pete Hegseth with David Goodwin", "contributor": "by Pete Hegseth with David Goodwin", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780063215047.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063215047?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0063215047", "isbn13": "9780063215047"}, {"isbn10": "0063215071", "isbn13": "9780063215078"}, {"isbn10": "006321508X", "isbn13": "9780063215085"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063215047?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780063215047?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780063215047"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FBATTLE%2BFOR%2BTHE%2BAMERICAN%2BMIND%2FPete%2BHegseth%2Bwith%2BDavid%2BGoodwin%2F9780063215047"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780063215047"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780063215047?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/17fe7fef-0365-5c1f-b51b-2dbad2c6261e", "list_date": "2022/09/25", "published_data": "2022", "summary": "\"Fox News host and New York Times bestselling author Pete Hegseth delivers his most important book yet: an excoriating examination of the state of America's broken education system that offers a helpful road map to raising children to uphold the values Americans have always treasured\"--"}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 15, "weeks_on_list": 20, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1984878107", "primary_isbn13": "9781984878106", "publisher": "Viking", "description": "An examination of the cognitive skills of rethinking and unlearning that could be used to adapt to a rapidly changing world.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Think Again", "author": "Adam Grant", "contributor": "by Adam Grant", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781984878106.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1984878107?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1984878107", "isbn13": "9781984878106"}, {"isbn10": "1984878115", "isbn13": "9781984878113"}, {"isbn10": "0593395786", "isbn13": "9780593395783"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1984878107?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781984878106?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781984878106"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHINK%2BAGAIN%2FAdam%2BGrant%2F9781984878106"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781984878106"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781984878106?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/63c6144a-3991-5653-ad88-4bca2e9afc1b", "list_date": "2022/09/25", "published_data": "2021-02-02", "summary": "#1 New York Times Bestseller \u201cTHIS.

In our daily lives, too many of us favor the comfort of conviction over the discomfort of doubt. We listen to opinions that make us feel good, instead of ideas that make us think hard. We see disagreement as a threat to our egos, rather than an opportunity to learn. We surround ourselves with people who agree with our conclusions, when we should be gravitating toward those who challenge our thought process. The result is that our beliefs get brittle long before our bones. We think too much like preachers defending our sacred beliefs, prosecutors proving the other side wrong, and politicians campaigning for approval--and too little like scientists searching for truth. Intelligence is no cure, and it can even be a curse: being good at thinking can make us worse at rethinking. The brighter we are, the blinder to our own limitations we can become. Organizational psychologist Adam Grant is an expert on opening other people's minds--and our own. As Wharton's top-rated professor and the bestselling author of Originals and Give and Take, he makes it one of his guiding principles to argue like he's right but listen like he's wrong. With bold ideas and rigorous evidence, he investigates how we can embrace the joy of being wrong, bring nuance to charged conversations, and build schools, workplaces, and communities of lifelong learners. You'll learn how an international debate champion wins arguments, a Black musician persuades white supremacists to abandon hate, a vaccine whisperer convinces concerned parents to immunize their children, and Adam has coaxed Yankees fans to root for the Red Sox. Think Again reveals that we don't have to believe everything we think or internalize everything we feel. It's an invitation to let go of views that are no longer serving us well and prize mental flexibility over foolish consistency. If knowledge is power, knowing what we don't know is wisdom."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 25, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0063076098", "primary_isbn13": "9780063076099", "publisher": "Dey Street", "description": "A memoir by the musician known for his work with Foo Fighters and Nirvana.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Storyteller", "author": "Dave Grohl", "contributor": "by Dave Grohl", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780063076099.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063076098?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0063076098", "isbn13": "9780063076099"}, {"isbn10": "006307611X", "isbn13": "9780063076112"}, {"isbn10": "0063076128", "isbn13": "9780063076129"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063076098?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780063076099?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780063076099"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BSTORYTELLER%2FDave%2BGrohl%2F9780063076099"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780063076099"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780063076099?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/93914c6c-1313-51de-aa16-047a120720a9", "list_date": "2022/09/25", "published_data": "2021-10-05", "summary": "So, I've written a book.

The joy that I have felt from chronicling these tales is not unlike listening back to a song that I've recorded and can't wait to share with the world, or reading a primitive journal entry from a stained notebook, or even hearing my voice bounce between the Kiss posters on my wall as a child. This certainly doesn't mean that I'm quitting my day job, but it does give me a place to shed a little light on what it's like to be a kid from Springfield, Virginia, walking through life while living out the crazy dreams I had as young musician. From hitting the road with Scream at 18 years old, to my time in Nirvana and the Foo Fighters, jamming with Iggy Pop or playing at the Academy Awards or dancing with AC/DC and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, drumming for Tom Petty or meeting Sir Paul McCartney at Royal Albert Hall, bedtime stories with Joan Jett or a chance meeting with Little Richard, to flying halfway around the world for one epic night with my daughters...the list goes on.

Life on the Mississippi is another epic, enchanting blend of history and adventure. Buck builds an authentic wooden flatboat from the early 1800s and pilots it down the Mississippi River, illuminating the forgotten past of the river and the grand \"flatboat era\" that dramatically extended the country in the decades before Western expansion. In 2015, readers, critics, and booksellers across the country fell in love with a singular American voice: Rinker Buck, whose infectious curiosity about history launched him across the West in a covered wagon and propelled his book, The Oregon Trail, to ten weeks on the New York Times hardcover bestseller list. The Oregon Trail was hailed as a \"real nonfiction thriller\" (The New York Review of Books), a \"quintessential American story\" (The Christian Science Monitor) that \"so ensnares the emotions it becomes a tear-jerker at its close\" (Star Tribune, Minneapolis) and \"will leave you daydreaming and hungry to see this land\" (The Boston Globe). The New York Times's Dwight Garner said that Buck's voice \"is alert and unpretentious in a manner that put me in mind of Bill Bryson's comic tone in A Walk in the Woods.\" Now, in his highly anticipated new book, Life on the Mississippi, Buck chronicles his latest grand adventure: building an authentic wooden flatboat from the bygone flatboat era of the early 1800s and journeying down the Mississippi River to New Orleans. A modern-day Huck Finn, Buck casts off down the river accompanied by an eccentric crew of daring shipmates. Over the course of his voyage, Buck steers his fragile wooden craft through narrow channels dominated by massive cargo barges, rescues his first mate gone overboard, sails blindly through fog, clashes with overzealous period reenactors, and much more. In addition, he charts his own geographical and emotional journey while also delivering a richly satisfying work of history that brings to life a lost era. The role of the flatboat in our country's evolution is far more significant than most Americans realize. Decades before we struck out for the Western territories, we migrated Southwest en masse. Between 1800 and 1840, millions of farmers, merchants, and hopeful pioneers embarked from states like Pennsylvania and Virginia on wooden flatboats headed beyond the Appalachians to places like Kentucky, Mississippi, and Louisiana. The mighty river currents carried waves of settlers and tons of cargo from farms to ports, populating new territories and revolutionizing the American landscape. As Buck points out, the inland rivers of the Ohio and Mississippi Valleys were in fact America's first western frontier. With a rare and captivating narrative power that blends armchair adventure with absorbing untold history, Life on the Mississippi is a muscular and majestic feat of storytelling from a writer who may be the closest to Twain that we have today."}, {"rank": 9, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 42, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "081298496X", "primary_isbn13": "9780812984965", "publisher": "Spiegel & Grau", "description": "A law professor and MacArthur grant recipient\u2019s memoir of his decades of work to free innocent people condemned to death.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Just Mercy", "author": "Bryan Stevenson", "contributor": "by Bryan Stevenson", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780812994520.jpg", "book_image_width": 128, "book_image_height": 193, "amazon_product_url": "http://www.amazon.com/Just-Mercy-Story-Justice-Redemption-ebook/dp/B00JYWVYLY?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/books/review/just-mercy-by-bryan-stevenson.html", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0812994523", "isbn13": "9780812994520"}, {"isbn10": "0553550608", "isbn13": "9780553550603"}, {"isbn10": "1925113574", "isbn13": "9781925113570"}, {"isbn10": "081298496X", "isbn13": "9780812984965"}, {"isbn10": "0593133935", "isbn13": "9780593133934"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "http://www.amazon.com/Just-Mercy-Story-Justice-Redemption-ebook/dp/B00JYWVYLY?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780812984965?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780812984965"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FJUST%2BMERCY%2FBryan%2BStevenson%2F9780812984965"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780812984965"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780812984965?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/cd6d25c8-a6f0-55a4-b322-e8eb0dbb5fb3", "list_date": "2022/09/11", "published_data": "2015-08-18", "summary": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE STARRING MICHAEL B.

There are five thousand years of written history, but perhaps millions more to come. In What We Owe the Future, philosopher William MacAskill develops a perspective he calls longtermism to argue that this fact is of enormous moral importance. While we are comfortable thinking about the equal moral worth of humans alive today, we haven't considered the moral weight of future generations. We have put them at grave risk, and not just with climate change. AI could lock humans into perpetual dystopia, or pandemics could end us. But the future could be wonderful: moral and technological progress could result in unimaginable human flourishing. The future is in our hands. As MacAskill shows, we can make the world better for billions of years to come. Perhaps even more importantly, he shows us just how much is at stake if we consign future generations to oblivion."}, {"rank": 9, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 60, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0316017930", "primary_isbn13": "9780316017930", "publisher": "Little, Brown", "description": "Unexpected factors that explain why some people succeed, such as upbringing, timing and 10,000 hours of deliberate practice.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Outliers", "author": "Malcolm Gladwell", "contributor": "by Malcolm Gladwell", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780316017930.jpg", "book_image_width": 184, "book_image_height": 280, "amazon_product_url": "http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/18/books/18kaku.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/books/review/Leonhardt-t.html", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0316017922", "isbn13": "9780316017923"}, {"isbn10": "0316040347", "isbn13": "9780316040341"}, {"isbn10": "0316017930", "isbn13": "9780316017930"}, {"isbn10": "1600243916", "isbn13": "9781600243912"}, {"isbn10": "031602497X", "isbn13": "9780316024976"}, {"isbn10": "1600243924", "isbn13": "9781600243929"}, {"isbn10": "0606324275", "isbn13": "9780606324274"}, {"isbn10": "1611133440", "isbn13": "9781611133448"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780316017930?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780316017930"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FOUTLIERS%2FMalcolm%2BGladwell%2F9780316017930"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780316017930"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780316017930?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/f91e18c2-0d6a-55fb-962e-f09204a77836", "list_date": "2022/09/04"}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 12, "weeks_on_list": 8, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593296923", "primary_isbn13": "9780593296929", "publisher": "Penguin Press", "description": "A look at arbitrary beliefs surrounding opium, caffeine and mescaline, which are derived from plants.", "price": "0.00", "title": "This Is Your Mind On Plants", "author": "Michael Pollan", "contributor": "by Michael Pollan", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593296905.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593296907?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593296907", "isbn13": "9780593296905"}, {"isbn10": "0593296915", "isbn13": "9780593296912"}, {"isbn10": "0593413105", "isbn13": "9780593413104"}, {"isbn10": "0593296923", "isbn13": "9780593296929"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593296907?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593296929?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593296929"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHIS%2BIS%2BYOUR%2BMIND%2BON%2BPLANTS%2FMichael%2BPollan%2F9780593296929"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593296929"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593296929?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/bbdb420f-8435-512f-82a4-1735548196f8", "list_date": "2022/09/04", "published_data": "2022-07-19", "summary": "The instant New York Times bestseller | A Washington Post Notable Book | One of NPR's Best Books of the Year \u201cExpert storytelling . . . [Pollan] masterfully elevates a series of big questions about drugs, plants and humans that are likely to leave readers thinking in new ways.\u201d \u2014New York Times Book Review From #1 New York Times bestselling author Michael Pollan, a radical challenge to how we think about drugs, and an exploration into the powerful human attraction to psychoactive plants\u2014and the equally powerful taboos. Of all the things humans rely on plants for\u2014sustenance, beauty, medicine, fragrance, flavor, fiber\u2014surely the most curious is our use of them to change consciousness: to stimulate or calm, fiddle with or completely alter, the qualities of our mental experience. Take coffee and tea: People around the world rely on caffeine to sharpen their minds. But we do not usually think of caffeine as a drug, or our daily use as an addiction, because it is legal and socially acceptable. So, then, what is a \u201cdrug\u201d? And why, for example, is making tea from the leaves of a tea plant acceptable, but making tea from a seed head of an opium poppy a federal crime? In This Is Your Mind on Plants, Michael Pollan dives deep into three plant drugs\u2014opium, caffeine, and mescaline\u2014and throws the fundamental strangeness, and arbitrariness, of our thinking about them into sharp relief. Exploring and participating in the cultures that have grown up around these drugs while consuming (or, in the case of caffeine, trying not to consume) them, Pollan reckons with the powerful human attraction to psychoactive plants. Why do we go to such great lengths to seek these shifts in consciousness, and then why do we fence that universal desire with laws and customs and fraught feelings? In this unique blend of history, science, and memoir, as well as participatory journalism, Pollan examines and experiences these plants from several very different angles and contexts, and shines a fresh light on a subject that is all too often treated reductively\u2014as a drug, whether licit or illicit. But that is one of the least interesting things you can say about these plants, Pollan shows, for when we take them into our bodies and let them change our minds, we are engaging with nature in one of the most profound ways we can. Based in part on an essay published almost twenty-five years ago, this groundbreaking and singular consideration of psychoactive plants, and our attraction to them through time, holds up a mirror to our fundamental human needs and aspirations, the operations of our minds, and our entanglement with the natural world."}, {"rank": 4, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0385548133", "primary_isbn13": "9780385548137", "publisher": "Doubleday", "description": "The Washington Post columnist describes Republican actions between the signing of the Contract With America and the Jan. 6 insurrection.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Destructionists", "author": "Dana Milbank", "contributor": "by Dana Milbank", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780385548137.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385548133?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0385548133", "isbn13": "9780385548137"}, {"isbn10": "0385548141", "isbn13": "9780385548144"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385548133?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780385548137?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780385548137"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BDESTRUCTIONISTS%2FDana%2BMilbank%2F9780385548137"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780385548137"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780385548137?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/a6c8eff5-3ca0-5d20-8edb-dad2bc87639d", "list_date": "2022/08/28", "published_data": "2022-08-09", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLER \u2022 A scalding history of twenty-five years of Republican attempts to hold on to political power by any means necessary, by a hugely popular Washington Post political columnist \"A thorough and scathing account of how the Republican Party fell prey to Trumpism.\"\u2014The New York Times Book Review In 1994, more than 300 Republicans under the command of obstructionist and rabble-rouser Congressman Newt Gingrich stood outside the U.S. Capitol to sign the Contract with America and put bipartisanship on notice. Twenty-five years later, on January 6, 2021, a bloodthirsty mob incited by President Trump invaded the Capitol. Dana Milbank sees a clear line from the Contract with America to the coup attempt. In the quarter century in between, Americans have witnessed the crackup of the party of Lincoln and Reagan, to its current iteration as a haven for white supremacists, political violence, conspiracy theories and authoritarianism. Following the questionable careers of party heavyweights Newt Gingrich, Karl Rove, Mitch McConnell, and Rudy Giuliani, and those of many lesser known lowlights, Millbank recounts the shocking lengths the Republican Party has gone to to maintain its grip on the American people."}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 14, "weeks_on_list": 17, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0375725601", "primary_isbn13": "9780375725609", "publisher": "Vintage", "description": "How an architect and a serial killer were linked by the Chicago World's Fair of 1893.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Devil In The White City", "author": "Erik Larson", "contributor": "by Erik Larson", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780375725609.jpg", "book_image_width": 300, "book_image_height": 475, "amazon_product_url": "http://www.amazon.com/The-Devil-White-City-Madness/dp/0375725601?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/10/books/books-of-the-times-add-a-serial-murderer-to-1893-chicago-s-opulent-overkill.html", "first_chapter_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/09/books/chapters/0309-1st-larson.html", "sunday_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/09/books/a-real-life-bates-motel.html", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0375725601", "isbn13": "9780375725609"}, {"isbn10": "1400076315", "isbn13": "9781400076314"}, {"isbn10": "0609608444", "isbn13": "9780609608449"}, {"isbn10": "0739323598", "isbn13": "9780739323595"}, {"isbn10": "1410455769", "isbn13": "9781410455765"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "http://www.amazon.com/The-Devil-White-City-Madness/dp/0375725601?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780375725609?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780375725609"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BDEVIL%2BIN%2BTHE%2BWHITE%2BCITY%2FErik%2BLarson%2F9780375725609"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780375725609"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780375725609?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/25b0cef2-b24a-59fa-975f-da31f87cce63", "list_date": "2022/08/28", "published_data": "2004-02-10", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 The true tale of the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago and the cunning serial killer who used the magic and majesty of the fair to lure his victims to their death. \u201cRelentlessly fuses history and entertainment to give this nonfiction book the dramatic effect of a novel .... It doesn\u2019t hurt that this truth is stranger than fiction.\u201d \u2014The New York Times Combining meticulous research with nail-biting storytelling, Erik Larson has crafted a narrative with all the wonder of newly discovered history and the thrills of the best fiction. Two men, each handsome and unusually adept at his chosen work, embodied an element of the great dynamic that characterized America\u2019s rush toward the twentieth century. The architect was Daniel Hudson Burnham, the fair\u2019s brilliant director of works and the builder of many of the country\u2019s most important structures, including the Flatiron Building in New York and Union Station in Washington, D.C. The murderer was Henry H. Holmes, a young doctor who, in a malign parody of the White City, built his \u201cWorld\u2019s Fair Hotel\u201d just west of the fairgrounds\u2014a torture palace complete with dissection table, gas chamber, and 3,000-degree crematorium. Burnham overcame tremendous obstacles and tragedies as he organized the talents of Frederick Law Olmsted, Charles McKim, Louis Sullivan, and others to transform swampy Jackson Park into the White City, while Holmes used the attraction of the great fair and his own satanic charms to lure scores of young women to their deaths. What makes the story all the more chilling is that Holmes really lived, walking the grounds of that dream city by the lake. The Devil in the White City draws the reader into the enchantment of the Guilded Age, made all the more appealing by a supporting cast of real-life characters, including Buffalo Bill, Theodore Dreiser, Susan B. Anthony, Thomas Edison, Archduke Francis Ferdinand, and others. Erik Larson\u2019s gifts as a storyteller are magnificently displayed in this rich narrative of the master builder, the killer, and the great fair that obsessed them both."}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1984879456", "primary_isbn13": "9781984879455", "publisher": "Viking", "description": "The physicist and creator of the YouTube series \u201cScience Without the Gobbledygook\" takes on some of the biggest questions in life and physics.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Existential Physics", "author": "Sabine Hossenfelder", "contributor": "by Sabine Hossenfelder", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781984879455.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1984879456?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1984879456", "isbn13": "9781984879455"}, {"isbn10": "1984879464", "isbn13": "9781984879462"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1984879456?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781984879455?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781984879455"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FEXISTENTIAL%2BPHYSICS%2FSabine%2BHossenfelder%2F9781984879455"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781984879455"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781984879455?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/d24b361b-d4ef-5910-96a0-64b955d5ba8e", "list_date": "2022/08/28", "published_data": "2022-08-09", "summary": "A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u201cAn informed and entertaining guide to what science can and cannot tell us.\u201d \u2014The Wall Street Journal \u201cStimulating . . . encourage[s] readers to push past well-trod assumptions [\u2026] and have fun doing so.\u201d \u2014Science Magazine From renowned physicist and creator of the YouTube series \u201cScience without the Gobbledygook,\u201d a book that takes a no-nonsense approach to life\u2019s biggest questions, and wrestles with what physics really says about the human condition Not only can we not currently explain the origin of the universe, it is questionable we will ever be able to explain it. The notion that there are universes within particles, or that particles are conscious, is ascientific, as is the hypothesis that our universe is a computer simulation. On the other hand, the idea that the universe itself is conscious is difficult to rule out entirely. According to Sabine Hossenfelder, it is not a coincidence that quantum entanglement and vacuum energy have become the go-to explanations of alternative healers, or that people believe their deceased grandmother is still alive because of quantum mechanics. Science and religion have the same roots, and they still tackle some of the same questions: Where do we come from? Where do we go to? How much can we know? The area of science that is closest to answering these questions is physics. Over the last century, physicists have learned a lot about which spiritual ideas are still compatible with the laws of nature. Not always, though, have they stayed on the scientific side of the debate. In this lively, thought-provoking book, Hossenfelder takes on the biggest questions in physics: Does the past still exist? Do particles think? Was the universe made for us? Has physics ruled out free will? Will we ever have a theory of everything? She lays out how far physicists are on the way to answering these questions, where the current limits are, and what questions might well remain unanswerable forever.

a woman today.\u201d\u2014Reese Witherspoon (Reese\u2019s Book Club Pick) In her most revealing and powerful memoir yet, the activist, speaker, bestselling author, and \u201cpatron saint of female empowerment\u201d (People) explores the joy and peace we discover when we stop striving to meet others\u2019 expectations and start trusting the voice deep within us. NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY O: The Oprah Magazine \u2022 The Washington Post \u2022 Cosmopolitan \u2022 Marie Claire \u2022 Bloomberg \u2022 Parade \u2022 \u201cUntamed will liberate women\u2014emotionally, spiritually, and physically. It is phenomenal.\u201d\u2014Elizabeth Gilbert, author of City of Girls and Eat Pray Love This is how you find yourself. There is a voice of longing inside each woman. We strive so mightily to be good: good partners, daughters, mothers, employees, and friends. We hope all this striving will make us feel alive. Instead, it leaves us feeling weary, stuck, overwhelmed, and underwhelmed. We look at our lives and wonder: Wasn\u2019t it all supposed to be more beautiful than this? We quickly silence that question, telling ourselves to be grateful, hiding our discontent\u2014even from ourselves. For many years, Glennon Doyle denied her own discontent. Then, while speaking at a conference, she looked at a woman across the room and fell instantly in love. Three words flooded her mind: There She Is. At first, Glennon assumed these words came to her from on high. But she soon realized they had come to her from within. This was her own voice\u2014the one she had buried beneath decades of numbing addictions, cultural conditioning, and institutional allegiances. This was the voice of the girl she had been before the world told her who to be. Glennon decided to quit abandoning herself and to instead abandon the world\u2019s expectations of her. She quit being good so she could be free. She quit pleasing and started living. Soulful and uproarious, forceful and tender, Untamed is both an intimate memoir and a galvanizing wake-up call. It is the story of how one woman learned that a responsible mother is not one who slowly dies for her children, but one who shows them how to fully live. It is the story of navigating divorce, forming a new blended family, and discovering that the brokenness or wholeness of a family depends not on its structure but on each member\u2019s ability to bring her full self to the table. And it is the story of how each of us can begin to trust ourselves enough to set boundaries, make peace with our bodies, honor our anger and heartbreak, and unleash our truest, wildest instincts so that we become women who can finally look at ourselves and say: There She Is. Untamed shows us how to be brave. As Glennon insists: The braver we are, the luckier we get."}, {"rank": 5, "rank_last_week": 3, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593296311", "primary_isbn13": "9780593296318", "publisher": "Penguin Press", "description": "A staff writer at The Atlantic details how some Republicans shifted their loyalty to Donald Trump.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Thank You For Your Servitude", "author": "Mark Leibovich", "contributor": "by Mark Leibovich", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593296318.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593296311?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593296311", "isbn13": "9780593296318"}, {"isbn10": "059329632X", "isbn13": "9780593296325"}, {"isbn10": "0593587111", "isbn13": "9780593587119"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593296311?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593296318?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593296318"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHANK%2BYOU%2BFOR%2BYOUR%2BSERVITUDE%2FMark%2BLeibovich%2F9780593296318"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593296318"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593296318?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/7faa31bf-be59-5c33-9481-18631bae803b", "list_date": "2022/08/14", "published_data": "2022-07-12", "summary": "The #1 New York Times Bestseller \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best chroniclers of politics today.\u201d \u2013Jake Tapper \u201cThis is a really funny book.\u201d \u2013Kara Swisher \u201cHis writing is so damn good.\u201d \u2013John Berman \u201cReally fascinating...There are so many revelations.\u201d \u2013Anderson Cooper \u201cThe new must read summer book.\u201d \u2013Stephanie Ruhle From the author of the #1 New York Times bestseller This Town, the eyewitness account of how the GOP collaborated with Donald Trump to transform Washington\u2019s \u201cswamp\u201d into a gold-plated hot tub\u2014and a onetime party of rugged individualists into a sycophantic personality cult. In the early months of Trump\u2019s candidacy, the Republican Party\u2019s most important figures, people such as Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Lindsey Graham, were united\u2014and loud\u2014in their scorn and contempt. Even more, in their outrage: Trump was a menace and an affront to our democracy. Then, awkwardly, Trump won. Thank You for Your Servitude is Mark Leibovich\u2019s unflinching account of the moral rout of a major American political party, tracking the transformation of Rubio, Cruz, Graham, and their ilk into the administration\u2019s chief enablers, and the swamp\u2019s lesser lights into frantic chasers of the grift. What would these politicos do to preserve their place in the sun, or at least the orbit of the spray tan? What would they do to preserve their \u201crelevance\u201d? Almost anything, it turns out. Trump\u2019s savage bullying of everyone in his circle, along with his singular command of his political base, created a dangerous culture of submission in the Republican Party. Meanwhile, many of the most alpha of the lapdogs happily conceded to Mark Leibovich that they were \u201cin on the joke.\u201d As Lindsey Graham told the author, his supporters in South Carolina generally don\u2019t read The New York Times, and they won\u2019t read this book, either. All that cynicism, shading into nihilism, led to a country truly unhinged from reality, and to the events of January 6, 2021. It\u2019s a vista that makes the Washington of This Town seem like a comedy of manners in comparison. Thank You for Your Servitude isn\u2019t another view from the Oval Office: it\u2019s the view from the Trump Hotel.

As the World Trade Center buildings collapsed, the Pentagon burned, and a small group of passengers fought desperately to stop a third plane from completing its deadly flight plan, America went on war footing. Killing The Killers narrates America's intense global war against extremists who planned and executed not only the 9/11 attacks, but hundreds of others in America and around the world, and who eventually destroyed entire nations in their relentless quest for power. Killing The Killers moves from Afghanistan to Iraq, Iran to Yemen, Syria, and Libya, and elsewhere, as the United States fought Al Qaeda, ISIS, and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, as well as individually targeting the most notorious leaders of these groups. With fresh detail and deeply-sourced information, O'Reilly and Dugard create an unstoppable account of the most important war of our era.\"--"}, {"rank": 2, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1635573971", "primary_isbn13": "9781635573978", "publisher": "Bloomsbury", "description": "Snapshots of various life and work events shared in a collection of essays.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Dirtbag, Massachusetts", "author": "Isaac Fitzgerald", "contributor": "by Isaac Fitzgerald", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781635573978.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1635573971?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1635573971", "isbn13": "9781635573978"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1635573971?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781635573978?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781635573978"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FDIRTBAG%252C%2BMASSACHUSETTS%2FIsaac%2BFitzgerald%2F9781635573978"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781635573978"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781635573978?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/e21109c8-e9a4-5418-b9fe-b31b5751e4cb", "list_date": "2022/08/07", "published_data": "2022-07-19", "summary": "The founding editor of BuzzFeed Books explores a more expansive vision of masculinity in a series of personal essays that chronicle his journey growing up in a Boston homeless shelter and efforts to take control of his own story."}, {"rank": 6, "rank_last_week": 9, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1250279003", "primary_isbn13": "9781250279002", "publisher": "St. Martin's", "description": "The author of \u201cThe Plot to Hack America\u201d examines radicalization and terror threats within the United States.", "price": "0.00", "title": "They Want To Kill Americans", "author": "Malcolm Nance", "contributor": "by Malcolm Nance", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781250279002.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250279003?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1250279003", "isbn13": "9781250279002"}, {"isbn10": "1250279011", "isbn13": "9781250279019"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250279003?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781250279002?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781250279002"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHEY%2BWANT%2BTO%2BKILL%2BAMERICANS%2FMalcolm%2BNance%2F9781250279002"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781250279002"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250279002?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/82cce654-cdda-5a02-8efe-3c4e8e418978", "list_date": "2022/08/07", "published_data": "2022-07-12", "summary": "NOW A NEW YORK TIMES, LOS ANGELES TIMES, USA TODAY AND GREAT LAKES INDEPENDENT BOOKSELLER ASSOCIATION BESTSELLER New York Times bestselling author, Malcolm Nance, offers a chilling warning on a clear, present and existential threat to our democracy... our fellow Americans \u201cMalcolm Nance is one of the great unsung national security geniuses of the modern era.\" \u2014Rachel Maddow To varying degrees, as many as 74 million Americans have expressed hostility towards American democracy. Their radicalization is increasingly visible in our day to day life: in neighbor\u2019s or family member\u2019s open discussion of bizarre conspiracy theories, reveling in the fantasy of mass murdering the liberals they believe are drinking the blood of children. These are the results of the deranged series of lies stoked by former President Donald Trump, made worse by the global pandemic. The first steps of an American fracture were predicted by Malcolm Nance months before the January 6, 2021 insurrection, heralding the start of a generational terror threat greater than either al-Qaeda or the Islamic State. Nance calls this growing unrest the Trump Insurgency in the United States or TITUS. The post-2020 election urge to return to a place of \u201cnormalcy\u201d\u2014to forget\u2014is the worst response we can have. American militiamen, terrorists, and radicalized political activists are already armed in mass numbers and regularly missed in the media; principally because Trump\u2019s most loyal and violent foot soldiers benefit from the ultimate privilege\u2014being white. They Want to Kill Americans is the first detailed look into the heart of the active Trump-led insurgency, setting the stage for a second nation-wide rebellion on American soil. This is a chilling and deeply researched early warning to the nation from a counterterrorism intelligence professional: America is primed for a possible explosive wave of terrorist attacks and armed confrontations that aim to bring about a Donald Trump led dictatorship."}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0063084392", "primary_isbn13": "9780063084391", "publisher": "Harper", "description": "The senior adviser on Pete Buttigieg\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign shares her journey in politics.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Any Given Tuesday", "author": "Lis Smith", "contributor": "by Lis Smith", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780063084391.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063084392?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0063084392", "isbn13": "9780063084391"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063084392?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780063084391?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780063084391"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FANY%2BGIVEN%2BTUESDAY%2FLis%2BSmith%2F9780063084391"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780063084391"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780063084391?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/dfbeb63a-cb45-5d64-9229-2e6b3ebb4e6d", "list_date": "2022/08/07", "published_data": "2022-07-19", "summary": "An irreverent look behind the scenes of American politics from one of the most sought-after operatives in the Democratic Party Lis Smith isn't your average political strategist and Any Given Tuesday isn't your typical political memoir. At once a revealing look at human nature at the highest levels of power and an intimate portrayal of a sometimes rocky personal journey, it breaks all the rules. Smith doesn't pretend to be perfect--she owns the controversial choices that landed her in the tabloids, as well as the unorthodox ones that have paid off and defined her successful career. Any Given Tuesday follows Smith from her earliest experiences as a college-aged intern to her days as a trusted adviser and confidante to some of the most high-profile politicians in the country--including her star turn as senior adviser on Pete Buttigieg's 2020 presidential campaign. Animated by Smith's love for the hand-to-hand combat of politics and sustained by her deeply-held belief that it's still possible to effect positive change, it's an odyssey full of highs and lows and larger-than-life characters. Throughout, Smith shows what it's really like behind the curtain: what happens when the lights go down and the cameras turn off, how it feels to be in the eye of the political media storm, and how the people responsible for heady, life and death decisions are as flawed as the rest of us. While the journey hasn't always been smooth, Lis Smith has seen and learned a lot--and she shares it all in this eye-opening, entertaining memoir."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 11, "weeks_on_list": 6, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0316397539", "primary_isbn13": "9780316397537", "publisher": "Little, Brown", "description": "The author\u2019s life, from growing up in small-town New York to working in the advertising industry to becoming a successful storyteller.", "price": "0.00", "title": "James Patterson", "author": "James Patterson", "contributor": "by James Patterson", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780316397537.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316397539?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0316397539", "isbn13": "9780316397537"}, {"isbn10": "0316397636", "isbn13": "9780316397636"}, {"isbn10": "0316445215", "isbn13": "9780316445214"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316397539?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780316397537?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780316397537"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FJAMES%2BPATTERSON%2FJames%2BPatterson%2F9780316397537"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780316397537"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780316397537?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/60a4ea26-a454-559c-9237-01a3ad8432ef", "list_date": "2022/08/07", "published_data": "2022-06-06", "summary": "How did a kid whose dad lived in the poorhouse become the most successful storyteller in the world? \u00b7 On the morning he was born, he nearly died. \u00b7 Growing up, he didn't love to read.

It is this intuitive grasp of direction that enables leaders to set objectives and lay down a strategy.\u201d In Leadership, Kissinger analyses the lives of six extraordinary leaders through the distinctive strategies of statecraft, which he believes they embodied.

Leadership is enriched by insights and judgements that only Kissinger could make and concludes with his reflections on world order and the indispensability of leadership today."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 6, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0063161478", "primary_isbn13": "9780063161474", "publisher": "Harper", "description": "The former Republican political operative assesses why some centrist conservatives fell under the sway of Donald Trump.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Why We Did It", "author": "Tim Miller", "contributor": "by Tim Miller", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780063161474.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063161478?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0063161478", "isbn13": "9780063161474"}, {"isbn10": "0063161486", "isbn13": "9780063161481"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063161478?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780063161474?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780063161474"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FWHY%2BWE%2BDID%2BIT%2FTim%2BMiller%2F9780063161474"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780063161474"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780063161474?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/1703311e-6273-5908-8377-a1e171f8be07", "list_date": "2022/07/31", "published_data": "2022", "summary": "\"An account of a former Republican political activist's horror as the party he loves becomes the party of Trump\"--"}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0358658969", "primary_isbn13": "9780358658962", "publisher": "Mariner", "description": "The former Army intelligence officer and Kansas City mayoral candidate shares his struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Invisible Storm", "author": "Jason Kander", "contributor": "by Jason Kander", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780358658962.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0358658969?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0358658969", "isbn13": "9780358658962"}, {"isbn10": "0358658675", "isbn13": "9780358658672"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0358658969?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780358658962?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780358658962"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FINVISIBLE%2BSTORM%2FJason%2BKander%2F9780358658962"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780358658962"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780358658962?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/91a20483-527b-521b-bbda-ad68c18ddec6", "list_date": "2022/07/24", "published_data": "2022-07-05", "summary": "In 2017, in President Obama's final Oval Office interview, he was asked who gave him hope for the future of the country.

Most military thinkers in the years leading up to World War II saw the airplane as an afterthought. But a small band of idealistic strategists, the \"Bomber Mafia,\" asked: What if precision bombing could cripple the enemy and make war far less lethal? In contrast, the bombing of Tokyo on the deadliest night of the war was the brainchild of General Curtis LeMay, whose brutal pragmatism and scorched-earth tactics in Japan cost thousands of civilian lives, but may have spared even more by averting a planned US invasion. In The Bomber Mafia, Gladwell asks, \"Was it worth it?\" Things might have gone differently had LeMay's predecessor, General Haywood Hansell, remained in charge. Hansell believed in precision bombing, but when he and Curtis LeMay squared off for a leadership handover in the jungles of Guam, LeMay emerged victorious, leading to the darkest night of World War II. The Bomber Mafia is a riveting tale of persistence, innovation, and the incalculable wages of war."}, {"rank": 7, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0385548516", "primary_isbn13": "9780385548519", "publisher": "Doubleday", "description": "A dozen articles, previously published in The New Yorker, which include profiles of a black-market arms merchant, a whistle-blower and the late Anthony Bourdain.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Rogues", "author": "Patrick Radden Keefe", "contributor": "by Patrick Radden Keefe", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780385548519.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385548516?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0385548516", "isbn13": "9780385548519"}, {"isbn10": "0385548524", "isbn13": "9780385548526"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385548516?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780385548519?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780385548519"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FROGUES%2FPatrick%2BRadden%2BKeefe%2F9780385548519"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780385548519"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780385548519?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/37458abe-8d50-5df2-be27-eb74ca1de10e", "list_date": "2022/07/17", "published_data": "2022-06-28", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 From the prize-winning, New York Times bestselling author of Empire of Pain and Say Nothing\u2014and one of the most decorated journalists of our time\u2014twelve enthralling stories of skulduggery and intrigue \u201cI read everything he writes.

For two generations, the Americans have held up the world's collective ceiling. Globe-spanning supply chains made possible under the protection of the U.S. Navy. Internationalized energy and financial markets underpinned by the American dollar. A global constellation of trade linkages, supply chains and operational norms too sprawling and interconnected to be maintained by the regional powers of Europe or Asia. A global food supply system made possible by massive inputs, technology, investment, and safe transport --all American-subsidized. We know this all as the era of free trade. The era of globalization. But the architecture of our world was always artificial. Temporary. In The End of the World is Just the Beginning, author and geopolitical strategist Peter Zeihan does more than simply explain how we got to where we are or describe the end days of the world we know. He maps out the next world: a world deglobalized. Region by region. Country by country. Industry by industry. The future of transportation in a world made insecure. The future of finance in a world without sufficient capital. The future of energy in a world disconnected. The future of industrial materials in a world deindustrializing. The future of manufacturing in a world of shattered supply chains. The future of agriculture in a world bereft of what's necessary to feed eight billion people. A world ending. A world beginning.

We fix them.\" Taking her father's words to heart, South Dakota's first woman governor Kristi Noem shares heartfelt - and heartbreaking - lessons on making things right in the world, from her childhood on a farm in the vastness of rural America, to the marbled halls of Congress, to the national spotlight amid a global pandemic. From humorous barnyard battles with feisty cattle and rodeo horses, to the tragic and untimely death of her larger-than-life father, to her decision to her decision to return and run the farm and ranch with her family, Noem invites readers into a life defined by work, faith, and helping others. Noem's reflections are offered in the familiar, unvarnished voice of a woman who later defied Washington's most powerful politicians and led the people of her small, hardscrabble state through natural disasters, the pain of a global pandemic, and the fear and turmoil that gripped the nation after. While filled with plenty of candid observations and refreshingly frank assessments of the country's leading figures, the memoir's most powerful moments nevertheless come from honest glimpses into marriage, motherhood, and leadership in an unpredictable time. Far from a book about politics, Not My First Rodeo is the story of a life lived so far - with characters as richly textured as the Black Hills, and reflections as gentle and powerful as America itself."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1982190914", "primary_isbn13": "9781982190910", "publisher": "Atria", "description": "The Green Beret and former mixed martial arts fighter describes how his failures shaped who he is today.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Scars And Stripes", "author": "Tim Kennedy and Nick Palmisciano", "contributor": "by Tim Kennedy and Nick Palmisciano", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781982190910.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982190914?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1982190914", "isbn13": "9781982190910"}, {"isbn10": "1982190930", "isbn13": "9781982190934"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982190914?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781982190910?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781982190910"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FSCARS%2BAND%2BSTRIPES%2FTim%2BKennedy%2Band%2BNick%2BPalmisciano%2F9781982190910"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781982190910"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781982190910?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/3f734fc9-db8e-5500-bdfd-174593e9c3a2", "list_date": "2022/07/17", "published_data": "2022-06-07", "summary": "INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER From decorated Green Beret sniper, UFC headliner, and all around badass, Tim Kennedy, a rollicking, inspirational memoir offering lessons in how to embrace failure and weather storms, in order to unlock the strongest version of yourself. Tim Kennedy has a problem; he only feels alive right before he\u2019s about to die. Kennedy, a Green Beret, decorated Army sniper, and UFC headliner, has tackled a bull with his bare hands, jumped out of airplanes, dove to the depths of the ocean, and traveled the world hunting poachers, human traffickers, and the Taliban. But he\u2019s also the same man who got kicked out of the police department, fire department, and as an EMT, before getting two women pregnant four days apart, and finally, been beaten up by his Special Forces colleagues for, quite simply, \u201cbeing a selfish asshole.\u201d In Scars and Stripes, Kennedy describes how these failures shaped him into the successful businessman and devoted husband and father he is today. Through unbelievably vivid, wild anecdotes Kennedy reveals all the dumb, violent, embarrassing, and undeniably heroic things he\u2019s done in his life, including multiple combat missions in Afghanistan, building a school in Texas for elementary kids, and creating two-multimillion-dollar businesses.

In the 19th century, there was a frenzy of interest in ancient Egypt. At the same time, European powers sent off waves of explorations intended to map the unknown corners of the globe \u2013 and extend their colonial empires. Richard Burton and John Hanning Speke were sent by the Royal Geographical Society to claim the prize for England. Burton spoke twenty-nine languages, and was a decorated soldier. He was also mercurial, subtle, and an iconoclastic atheist. Speke was a young aristocrat and Army officer determined to make his mark, passionate about hunting, Burton\u2019s opposite in temperament and beliefs. From the start the two men clashed. They would endure tremendous hardships, illness, and constant setbacks. Two years in, deep in the African interior, Burton became too sick to press on, but Speke did, and claimed he found the source in a great lake that he christened Lake Victoria. When they returned to England, Speke rushed to take credit, disparaging Burton. Burton disputed his claim, and Speke launched another expedition to Africa to prove it. The two became venomous enemies, with the public siding with the more charismatic Burton, to Speke\u2019s great envy. The day before they were to publicly debate,Speke shot himself. Yet there was a third man on both expeditions, his name obscured by imperial annals, whose exploits were even more extraordinary. This was Sidi Mubarak Bombay, who was enslaved and shipped from his home village in East Africa to India. When the man who purchased him died, he made his way into the local Sultan\u2019s army, and eventually traveled back to Africa, where he used his resourcefulness, linguistic prowess and raw courage to forge a living as a guide. Without Bombay and men like him, who led, carried, and protected the expedition, neither Englishman would have come close to the headwaters of the Nile, or perhaps even survived. In River of the Gods Candice Millard has written another peerless story of courage and adventure, set against the backdrop of the race to exploit Africa by the colonial powers."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 7, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1982118180", "primary_isbn13": "9781982118181", "publisher": "Atria/One Signal", "description": "The MSNBC anchor describes growing up with her helicopter journalist parents and her own journey in covering the news.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Rough Draft", "author": "Katy Tur", "contributor": "by Katy Tur", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781982118181.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982118180?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1982118180", "isbn13": "9781982118181"}, {"isbn10": "1982118202", "isbn13": "9781982118204"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982118180?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781982118181?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781982118181"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FROUGH%2BDRAFT%2FKaty%2BTur%2F9781982118181"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781982118181"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781982118181?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/eca96ae1-baf6-5387-a960-66ac8224a32b", "list_date": "2022/07/10", "published_data": "2022-06-14", "summary": "\"When a box from her mother showed up on Katy Tur's doorstep, months into the pandemic and just as she learned she was pregnant with her second child, she didn't now what to expect.

Like all his books, this one is accessible to everyone regardless of race or class.\u201d\u2014Los Angeles Times (Book Club Pick) The tragedies and reckonings around racism that are rocking the country have created a specific crisis for parents, educators, and other caregivers: How do we talk to our children about racism? How do we teach children to be antiracist? How are kids at different ages experiencing race? How are racist structures impacting children? How can we inspire our children to avoid our mistakes, to be better, to make the world better? These are the questions Ibram X. Kendi found himself avoiding as he anticipated the birth of his first child. Like most parents or parents-to-be, he felt the reflex to not talk to his child about racism, which he feared would stain her innocence and steal away her joy. But research and experience changed his mind, and he realized that raising his child to be antiracist would actually protect his child, and preserve her innocence and joy. He realized that teaching students about the reality of racism and the myth of race provides a protective education in our diverse and unequal world. He realized that building antiracist societies safeguards all children from the harms of racism. Following the accessible genre of his internationally bestselling How to Be an Antiracist, Kendi combines a century of scientific research with a vulnerable and compelling personal narrative of his own journey as a parent and as a child in school. The chapters follow the stages of child development from pregnancy to toddler to schoolkid to teenager. It is never too early or late to start raising young people to be antiracist."}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 4, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1476797099", "primary_isbn13": "9781476797090", "publisher": "Avid Reader", "description": "An unauthorized biography of the golf champion Phil Mickelson.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Phil", "author": "Alan Shipnuck", "contributor": "by Alan Shipnuck", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781476797090.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1476797099?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1476797099", "isbn13": "9781476797090"}, {"isbn10": "1476797110", "isbn13": "9781476797113"}, {"isbn10": "1797144049", "isbn13": "9781797144047"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1476797099?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781476797090?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781476797090"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FPHIL%2FAlan%2BShipnuck%2F9781476797090"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781476797090"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781476797090?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/6dc00bf5-bd30-5778-a8b1-769d70e80721", "list_date": "2022/07/03", "published_data": "2022-05-17", "summary": "\"In this raw, uncensored, and unauthorized biography, Alan Shipnuck captures a singular life defined by thrilling victories, crushing defeats, and countless controversies.

In DISINFORMATION NATION, bestselling author Dan Pfeiffer returns to lay out how the Right Wing built such a robust and successful disinformation machine, how they have used it to amass power despite representing a dwindling share of the country, and how readers can fight back against disinformation with step-by-step guides on spotting fake news, becoming their own fact checker, and talking to their conspiracy theory-obsessed relatives. Over the last twenty years, the Right Wing has built a massive media apparatus that is weaponizing misinformation for political purposes. The Right Wing media ecosystem personified by Fox and fueled by Facebook is waging war on the very idea of objective truth--and it's winning. This misinformation campaign is at the root of much that is rotten in America and around the world. Trump is a product of this eco-system as is the immense polarization and division and our inability to deal rationally with immense threats like COVID and Climate Change. Here, Pfeiffer lays bare the tactics used by the Right Wing propaganda machine and how to combat them, including: QAnon and its proponents, from Facebook groups to members of congress The optimization of Facebook as the ultimate carrier of Right Wing clickbait Educating the Left to \"fight fire with fire\" and nurture progressive media How to have hard conversations with the Fox News-watching, conspiracy theory-believing relative in your life A functioning democracy depends on a shared understanding of reality. America is teetering on the edge because one of the two parties in our two-party system views truth, facts, and science as their opponent.

It\u2019s all here: what it\u2019s like to be dissected on national television. How to outsmart the media mob. How to outclass the crazy critics. How to survive and succeed male-dominated industries. What happens when the perils of social media really hit home. And what happens when the divisions across the country start playing out in one\u2019s own family. In this open and vulnerable account, Kellyanne turns the camera on herself. What she has to share\u2014about our politics, about the media, about her time in the White House, and about her personal journey\u2014is an astonishing glimpse of visibility and vulnerability, of professional and personal highs and lows, and ultimately, of triumph."}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0812989945", "primary_isbn13": "9780812989946", "publisher": "Random House", "description": "A depiction of Pope Pius XII\u2019s actions during World War II and why he bent to the wills of Hitler and Mussolini.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Pope At War", "author": "David I.

Those questions have only grown and festered, making Pius XII one of the most controversial popes in Church history, especially now as the Vatican prepares to canonize him. In 2020, Pius XII\u2019s archives were finally opened, and David I. Kertzer\u2014widely recognized as one of the world\u2019s leading Vatican scholars\u2014has been mining this new material ever since, revealing how the pope came to set aside moral leadership in order to preserve his church\u2019s power. Based on thousands of never-before-seen documents not only from the Vatican, but from archives in Italy, Germany, France, Britain, and the United States, The Pope at War paints a new, dramatic portrait of what the pope did and did not do as war enveloped the continent and as the Nazis began their systematic mass murder of Europe\u2019s Jews. The book clears away the myths and sheer falsehoods surrounding the pope\u2019s actions from 1939 to 1945, showing why the pope repeatedly bent to the wills of Hitler and Mussolini. Just as Kertzer\u2019s Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning The Pope and Mussolini became the definitive book on Pope Pius XI and the Fascist regime, The Pope at War is destined to become the most influential account of his successor, Pius XII, and his relations with Mussolini and Hitler. Kertzer shows why no full understanding of the course of World War II is complete without knowledge of the dramatic, behind-the-scenes role played by the pope. \u201cThis remarkably researched book is replete with revelations that deserve the adjective \u2018explosive,\u2019\u201d says Kevin Madigan, Winn Professor of Ecclesiastical History at Harvard University. \u201cThe Pope at War is a masterpiece.\u201d"}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 11, "weeks_on_list": 7, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1400032806", "primary_isbn13": "9781400032808", "publisher": "Anchor", "description": "Two brothers who subscribed to a fundamentalist version of Mormonism killed a woman and her daughter; the basis of the TV series.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Under The Banner Of Heaven", "author": "Jon Krakauer", "contributor": "by Jon Krakauer", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781400032808.jpg", "book_image_width": 323, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1400032806?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/03/books/thou-shalt-kill.html", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1400032806", "isbn13": "9781400032808"}, {"isbn10": "1400078997", "isbn13": "9781400078998"}, {"isbn10": "0736698221", "isbn13": "9780736698221"}, {"isbn10": "0739306588", "isbn13": "9780739306581"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1400032806?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781400032808?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781400032808"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FUNDER%2BTHE%2BBANNER%2BOF%2BHEAVEN%2FJon%2BKrakauer%2F9781400032808"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781400032808"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781400032808?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/b22ac61b-e1c2-545c-8e75-3cadab6610fa", "list_date": "2022/06/26", "published_data": "2004-06-08", "summary": "NATIONAL BESTSELLER \u2022 From the author of Into the Wild and Into Thin Air, this extraordinary work of investigative journalism takes readers inside America\u2019s isolated Mormon Fundamentalist communities.

Secret City is not gay history. It is American history.\" --George Stephanopoulos Washington, D.C., has always been a city of secrets. Few have been more dramatic than the ones revealed in James Kirchick's Secret City. For decades, the specter of homosexuality haunted Washington. The mere suggestion that a person might be gay destroyed reputations, ended careers, and ruined lives. At the height of the Cold War, fear of homosexuality became intertwined with the growing threat of international communism, leading to a purge of gay men and lesbians from the federal government. In the fevered atmosphere of political Washington, the secret \"too loathsome to mention\" paradoxically held enormous, terrifying power. Utilizing thousands of pages of declassified documents, interviews with over one hundred people, and material unearthed from presidential libraries and archives around the country, Secret City: The Hidden History of Gay Washington is a chronicle of American politics like no other. Beginning with the tragic story of Sumner Welles, Franklin Delano Roosevelt's brilliant diplomatic advisor and the man at the center of \"the greatest national scandal since the existence of the United States,\" award-winning journalist and author James Kirchick illuminates how the idea of homosexuality shaped each successive presidential administration, impacting everything from the creation of America's earliest civilian intelligence agency to the rise and fall of McCarthyism, the struggle for African American civil rights, and the conservative movement. Celebrating the men and women who courageously decided that the source of their private shame could instead be galvanized for public pride, Kirchick offers a reinterpretation of American history told from the perspective of the citizens who lived in its shadows. Sweeping in scope and intimate in detail, Secret City will forever transform our understanding of American history."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 7, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0063007592", "primary_isbn13": "9780063007598", "publisher": "Dey Street", "description": "Two stars of \u201cThe Office\u201d celebrate the comedy series and their friendship.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Office Bffs", "author": "Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey", "contributor": "by Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780063007598.jpg", "book_image_width": 381, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063007592?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0063007592", "isbn13": "9780063007598"}, {"isbn10": "0063246791", "isbn13": "9780063246799"}, {"isbn10": "0063007606", "isbn13": "9780063007604"}, {"isbn10": "0063246805", "isbn13": "9780063246805"}, {"isbn10": "0063007614", "isbn13": "9780063007611"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063007592?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780063007598?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780063007598"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BOFFICE%2BBFFS%2FJenna%2BFischer%2Band%2BAngela%2BKinsey%2F9780063007598"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780063007598"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780063007598?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/7b693210-b7ae-5e6d-8ebe-3deb2851013e", "list_date": "2022/06/19", "published_data": "2022-05-17", "summary": "Receptionist Pam Beesly and accountant Angela Martin had very little in common when they toiled together at Scranton's Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.

Preppy ice queen in Legally Blonde. Muse to Karl Lagerfeld. Advocate for the multiple sclerosis community. But before all of that, Selma was known best as \u2026 a mean baby. In a memoir that is as wildly funny as it is emotionally shattering, Blair tells the captivating story of growing up and finding her truth. \"Blair is a rebel, an artist, and it turns out: a writer.\" \u2014Glennon Doyle, Author of the #1 New York Times Bestseller Untamed and Founder of Together Rising The first story Selma Blair Beitner ever heard about herself is that she was a mean, mean baby. With her mouth pulled in a perpetual snarl and a head so furry it had to be rubbed to make way for her forehead, Selma spent years living up to her terrible reputation: biting her sisters, lying spontaneously, getting drunk from Passover wine at the age of seven, and behaving dramatically so that she would be the center of attention. Although Selma went on to become a celebrated Hollywood actress and model, she could never quite shake the periods of darkness that overtook her, the certainty that there was a great mystery at the heart of her life. She often felt like her arms might be on fire, a sensation not unlike electric shocks, and she secretly drank to escape. Over the course of this beautiful and, at times, devasting memoir, Selma lays bare her addiction to alcohol, her devotion to her brilliant and complicated mother, and the moments she flirted with death. There is brutal violence, passionate love, true friendship, the gift of motherhood, and, finally, the surprising salvation of a multiple sclerosis diagnosis. In a voice that is powerfully original, fiercely intelligent, and full of hard-won wisdom, Selma Blair\u2019s Mean Baby is a deeply human memoir and a true literary achievement."}, {"rank": 9, "rank_last_week": 7, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1982172487", "primary_isbn13": "9781982172480", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "description": "Two New York Times correspondents chronicle the 2020 election and the first year of the Biden presidency.", "price": "0.00", "title": "This Will Not Pass", "author": "Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns", "contributor": "by Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781982172480.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982172487?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1982172487", "isbn13": "9781982172480"}, {"isbn10": "1982172509", "isbn13": "9781982172503"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982172487?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781982172480?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781982172480"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHIS%2BWILL%2BNOT%2BPASS%2FJonathan%2BMartin%2Band%2BAlexander%2BBurns%2F9781982172480"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781982172480"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781982172480?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/1d6b7894-313d-575c-9b99-2ec2dcd70964", "list_date": "2022/06/05", "published_data": "2022-05-03", "summary": "\"New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns show how both our political parties confronted a series of national traumas, including the coronavirus pandemic, the January 6 attack on the Capitol, and the political brinksmanship of President Biden's first year in the White House.

In this revelatory, unnerving, and ultimately hopeful book, Bremmer details how domestic and international conflicts leave us unprepared for a trio of looming crises\u2014global health emergencies, transformative climate change, and the AI revolution. Today, Americans cannot reach consensus on any significant political issue, and US and Chinese leaders behave as if they\u2019re locked in a new Cold War. We are squandering opportunities to meet the challenges that will soon confront us all. In coming years, humanity will face viruses deadlier and more infectious than Covid. Intensifying climate change will put tens of millions of refugees in flight and require us to reimagine how we live our daily lives. Most dangerous of all, new technologies will reshape the geopolitical order, disrupting our livelihoods and destabilizing our societies faster than we can grasp and address their implications. The good news? Some farsighted political leaders, business decision-makers, and individual citizens are already collaborating to tackle all these crises. The question that should keep us awake is whether they will work well and quickly enough to limit the fallout\u2014and, most importantly, whether we can use these crises to innovate our way toward a better world. Drawing on strategies both time-honored and cutting-edge, from the Marshall Plan to the Green New Deal, The Power of Crisis provides a roadmap for surviving\u2014even thriving in\u2014the 21st century. Bremmer shows governments, corporations, and every concerned citizen how we can use these coming crises to create the worldwide prosperity and opportunity that 20th-century globalism promised but failed to deliver."}, {"rank": 4, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0063230291", "primary_isbn13": "9780063230293", "publisher": "HarperOne", "description": "A 98-year-old woman who gained attention through TikTok videos tells her story of surviving Auschwitz.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Lily'S Promise", "author": "Lily Ebert and Dov Forman", "contributor": "by Lily Ebert and Dov Forman", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780063230293.jpg", "book_image_width": 334, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063230291?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0063230291", "isbn13": "9780063230293"}, {"isbn10": "0063230283", "isbn13": "9780063230286"}, {"isbn10": "0063230275", "isbn13": "9780063230279"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063230291?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780063230293?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780063230293"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FLILY%2527S%2BPROMISE%2FLily%2BEbert%2Band%2BDov%2BForman%2F9780063230293"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780063230293"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780063230293?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/f13e613f-f7a1-59ba-b1c3-1d52044bfb9d", "list_date": "2022/05/29", "published_data": "2022-05-10", "summary": "\"Utterly compelling, heartbreaking, truthful and yet redemptive, a memoir of the Holocaust, a testimony of irrepressible spirit and an unforgettable family chronicle, written in lucid prose by a truly remarkable woman about her life from Hungary to Auschwitz, Israel to London. I couldn't stop reading it.\"--Simon Sebag Montefiore In this heartbreaking yet life-affirming intergenerational memoir, a Holocaust survivor and her great-grandson share her remarkable story. It isan unforgettable tale of resilience and resistance in the face of extreme hardship, the importance and bravery of starting over, the power of healing, and the gift of keeping memories alive from generation to generation. On Yom Kippur, 1944, Lily Ebert made a promise. She would survive the hell of Auschwitz and, when finally freed, tell the world her story to help prevent such evil from ever happening again. Now, at ninety-seven, this remarkable woman fulfills that vow, sharing the details of her experiences with candor, charm, and overflowing heart.Lily's Promise begins with her happy childhood in Hungary, and the terror that descended when war broke out. Deported to Auschwitz, Lily speaks movingly of the shocking cruelty and systematic dehumanization inflicted by the Nazis, and how survival with her younger sisters Rene and Piri felt impossible. But the girls' love for each other allowed them to endure the horror after they lost their mother and two youngest siblings, and even when they faced a death march in the war's final days. Lily's care for others, strength of character, and small acts of resistance against evil kept her alive and made her an incredible leader for those around her. When she was liberated from Auschwitz in 1945, a Jewish-American soldier gave her a bank note on which he'd written \"Good luck and happiness.\" Nearly seventy-five years later, her great-grandson, Dov, turned to social media to find that GI's family, and word of Lily's remarkable heroism began to spread. Dov knows that it is up to younger people like him to keep Lily's promise alive, to remind us we cannot forget. Together, he and Lily bridge the gap between generations to impart the truth about the Holocaust to others. Featuring a 16 page black-and-white photo insert, Lily's Promise makes clear that their family history is our history as well--and reminds us that joy accompanies the solemn responsibility of keeping the past and our stories alive."}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593297067", "primary_isbn13": "9780593297063", "publisher": "Viking", "description": "A look at our 21st-century lives covering food production, globalization and the environment, and prognostications on our quality of life ahead.", "price": "0.00", "title": "How The World Really Works", "author": "Vaclav Smil", "contributor": "by Vaclav Smil", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593297063.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593297067?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593297067", "isbn13": "9780593297063"}, {"isbn10": "0593297075", "isbn13": "9780593297070"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593297067?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593297063?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593297063"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FHOW%2BTHE%2BWORLD%2BREALLY%2BWORKS%2FVaclav%2BSmil%2F9780593297063"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593297063"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593297063?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/e934aded-3ac8-5a35-a987-ba9133eb1418", "list_date": "2022/05/29", "published_data": "2022-05-10", "summary": "INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u201cA new masterpiece from one of my favorite authors\u2026 [How The World Really Works] is a compelling and highly readable book that leaves readers with the fundamental grounding needed to help solve the world\u2019s toughest challenges.\u201d\u2014Bill Gates \u201cProvocative but perceptive . . .

We have never had so much information at our fingertips and yet most of us don\u2019t know how the world really works. This book explains seven of the most fundamental realities governing our survival and prosperity. From energy and food production, through our material world and its globalization, to risks, our environment and its future, How the World Really Works offers a much-needed reality check\u2014because before we can tackle problems effectively, we must understand the facts. In this ambitious and thought-provoking book we see, for example, that globalization isn\u2019t inevitable\u2014the foolishness of allowing 70 per cent of the world\u2019s rubber gloves to be made in just one factory became glaringly obvious in 2020\u2014and that our societies have been steadily increasing their dependence on fossil fuels, such that any promises of decarbonization by 2050 are a fairy tale. For example, each greenhouse-grown supermarket-bought tomato has the equivalent of five tablespoons of diesel embedded in its production, and we have no way of producing steel, cement or plastics at required scales without huge carbon emissions. Ultimately, Smil answers the most profound question of our age: are we irrevocably doomed or is a brighter utopia ahead? Compelling, data-rich and revisionist, this wonderfully broad, interdisciplinary guide finds faults with both extremes.

Fox In this beautiful, close-to-the bone account, Jennifer Grey takes readers on a vivid tour of the experiences that have shaped her, from her childhood as the daughter of Broadway and film legend Joel Grey, to the surprise hit with Patrick Swayze that made her America\u2019s sweetheart, to her inspiring season eleven win on ABC\u2019s Dancing with the Stars. Throughout this intimate narrative, Grey richly evokes places and times that were defining for a generation\u2014from her preteen days in 1970s Malibu and wild child nights in New York\u2019s club scene, to her roles in quintessential movies of the 1980s, including The Cotton Club, Red Dawn, and her breakout performance in Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off. With self-deprecating humor and frankness, she looks back on her unbridled, romantic adventures in Hollywood. And with enormous bravery, she shares the devastating fallout from a plastic surgery procedure that caused the sudden and stunning loss of her professional identity and career. Grey inspires with her hard-won battle back, reclaiming her sense of self from a culture and business that can impose a narrow and unforgiving definition of female worth. She finds, at last, her own true north and starts a family of her own, just in the nick of time. Distinctive, moving, and powerful, told with generosity and pluck, Out of the Corner is a memoir about a never-ending personal evolution, a coming-of-age story for women of every age."}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0062980866", "primary_isbn13": "9780062980861", "publisher": "Harper", "description": "The comedic actress shares stories of joy and despair during the Covid-19 pandemic.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Ali'S Well That Ends Well", "author": "Ali Wentworth", "contributor": "by Ali Wentworth", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780062980861.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062980866?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0062980866", "isbn13": "9780062980861"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062980866?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780062980861?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780062980861"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FALI%2527S%2BWELL%2BTHAT%2BENDS%2BWELL%2FAli%2BWentworth%2F9780062980861"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780062980861"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062980861?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/5bf4449e-aa8b-5e1d-bb76-7cb51a6a4057", "list_date": "2022/05/29", "published_data": "2022-05-10", "summary": "New York Times bestselling author Ali Wentworth offers a comedic look at family, friendship, and lessons learned during the Covid-19 pandemic in her new collection of laugh-out-loud comic vignettes. Like many, Ali Wentworth spent the pandemic seesawing between highs, lows, and baking an unnecessary amount of chocolate cake. Between binging every tv show in existence to conquering TikTok to becoming a (semi) empty-nester, Ali experienced her share of turmoil (including an early case of Covid), but she also grew a little, learned a lot, and found comfort in some unexpected people and places. In Ali's Well that Ends Well, Wentworth turns her gimlet eye to the year no one saw coming. With her signature irreverent style, she shares the most hysterical, absurd, and sometimes trying episodes that her family endured during the terrible global pandemic. Thoroughly relatable, absolutely charming, and filled with moments both hilarious and poignant, this terrific collection once again showcases the comedic genius of a beloved star who is \"the girlfriend you want to have a glass of wine with, the one who makes you laugh because she sees the funny and the absurd in everything\" (Huffington Post)."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 0,

upbringing to bodyguarding for Snoop Dogg, to becoming a wrestling icon and one of the most provocative on-air voices today. The product of a 1970s mixed marriage, George Murdoch learned to fight early in life, fending off both race-baiting bullies and the demons of a dysfunctional home. Couch surfing all through high school and most of college, the quick-witted, sharp-tongued giant played football, ran drugs, and bounced at clubs to try to survive. After a false start with the WWE, he eventually became Snoop Dogg\u2019s bodyguard and traveled the world with the hip hop legend, biding his time and honing his rap.

From there, Molly ventured into the wider world of New York and Los Angeles show business, where she created her own opportunities and developed her daring and empathetic comedy. Filled with behind-the-scenes stories involving everyone from Whitney Houston to Adam Sandler to Monica Lewinski, many told for the first time here, Hello, Molly! spans Molly's time on Saturday Night Live--where she starred alongside Will Ferrell, Adam Sandler, Cheri Oteri, Tracy Morgan, and Jimmy Fallon, among many others. At the same time, it explores with humor and candor her struggle to come to terms with the legacy of her father, a man who both fostered her gifts and drive and was left with the impossible task of raising his kids alone after the loss of her mother.

Many of us assume that the more successful we are, the less susceptible we become to the sense of professional and social irrelevance that often accompanies aging. But the truth is, the greater our achievements and our attachment to them, the more we notice our decline, and the more painful it is when it occurs. What can we do, starting now, to make our older years a time of happiness, purpose, and yes, success? At the height of his career at the age of 50, Arthur Brooks embarked on a seven-year journey to discover how to transform his future from one of disappointment over waning abilities into an opportunity for progress. From Strength to Strength is the result, a practical roadmap for the rest of your life. Drawing on social science, philosophy, biography, theology, and eastern wisdom, as well as dozens of interviews with everyday men and women, Brooks shows us that true life success is well within our reach. By refocusing on certain priorities and habits that anyone can learn, such as deep wisdom, detachment from empty rewards, connection and service to others, and spiritual progress, we can set ourselves up for increased happiness.

Delia Ephron tried to disconnect her late husband's landline and crashed her internet. After a prolonged battle with Verizon, she did what she always does. She wrote about it, channeling her grief and frustration into a New York Times op ed. Months later, she got an email to commiserate from a man she'd had two dates with while in college, 54 years ago. She didn't remember him but he remembered her. After three weeks of mutually passionate emails and 60s folk songs, he flew across the country to see her. They were crazily in love. What could go wrong? Acute Myeloid Leukemia, which also took her beloved older sister, struck her three months into this new blissful life. Because Delia Ephron survived and is a singular writer who tells her story in a way that brings you right next to her and seesaws you between tears and laughter, in this memoir, you will join her, going inside the giddy highs (even the initial falling in love emails are here) and the suicidal lows of enduring cutting-edge treatment (accurately presented and vetted by her amazing team of doctors) for a life-threatening cancer. The collision of love and illness makes for a traumatic but ultimately redemptive roller coaster ride, which Ephron writes with page-turning drama. With Peter's devotion, with close friends and family buoying her with hope, with startling clarity, warmth, and honesty about facing death, Delia invites us to join her team of warriors and become believers ourselves."}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 10, "weeks_on_list": 4, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0063139464", "primary_isbn13": "9780063139466", "publisher": "Harper Perennial", "description": "A re-examination of Greek myths and their female characters through a woman\u2019s perspective.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Pandora'S Jar", "author": "Natalie Haynes", "contributor": "by Natalie Haynes", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780063139466.jpg", "book_image_width": 332, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063139464?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0063139464", "isbn13": "9780063139466"}, {"isbn10": "0063139472", "isbn13": "9780063139473"}, {"isbn10": "0063211319", "isbn13": "9780063211315"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063139464?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780063139466?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780063139466"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FPANDORA%2527S%2BJAR%2FNatalie%2BHaynes%2F9780063139466"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780063139466"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780063139466?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/9c5790ec-26d6-5e43-ab54-d01d13d7c645", "list_date": "2022/05/08", "published_data": "2022-03", "summary": "\"Funny, sharp explications of what these sometimes not-very-nice women were up to, and how they sometimes made idiots of . . . but read on!\"--Margaret Atwood, author of The Handmaid's Tale The national bestselling author of A Thousand Ships returns with a fascinating, eye-opening take on the remarkable women at the heart of classical stories Greek mythology from Helen of Troy to Pandora and the Amazons to Medea. The tellers of Greek myths--historically men--have routinely sidelined the female characters. When they do take a larger role, women are often portrayed as monstrous, vengeful or just plain evil--like Pandora, the woman of eternal scorn and damnation whose curiosity is tasked with causing all the world's suffering and wickedness when she opened that forbidden box. But, as Natalie Hayes reveals, in early Greek myths there was no box. It was a jar . . . which is far more likely to tip over. In Pandora's Jar, the broadcaster, writer, stand-up comedian, and passionate classicist turns the tables, putting the women of the Greek myths on an equal footing with the men. With wit, humor, and savvy, Haynes revolutionizes our understanding of epic poems, stories, and plays, resurrecting them from a woman's perspective and tracing the origins of their mythic female characters. She looks at women such as Jocasta, Oedipus' mother-turned-lover (turned Freudian sticking point), who gouged out her eyes upon discovering the truth about her new relationship, and was less helpless than we have been led to believe. She considers Helen of Troy--whose face famously \"launch'd a thousand ships,\" but was decidedly more child than woman when she was accused of \"causing\" the Trojan war. She demonstrates how the vilified Medea was like an ancient Beyonce--getting her revenge on the men who hurt and betrayed her, perhaps justifiably so. And she turns her eye to Medusa--the serpent-like seductress whose stare turned men to stone--who wasn't always a monster, and was far more victim than perpetrator. Pandora's Jar brings nuance and care to the centuries-old myths and legends and asks the question: Why we were so quick to villainize these women in the first place--and so eager to accept the stories we've been told?"}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 7, "weeks_on_list": 4, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1476755744", "primary_isbn13": "9781476755748", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "description": "An American hedge fund manager in Russia is expelled by kleptocrats who then seize his property.

Poland and Czechoslovakia had already fallen, and the Dunkirk evacuation was just two weeks away. For the next twelve months, Hitler would wage a relentless bombing campaign, killing 45,000 Britons. It was up to Churchill to hold his country together and persuade President Franklin Roosevelt that Britain was a worthy ally\u2014and willing to fight to the end. In The Splendid and the Vile, Erik Larson shows, in cinematic detail, how Churchill taught the British people \u201cthe art of being fearless.\u201d It is a story of political brinkmanship, but it\u2019s also an intimate domestic drama, set against the backdrop of Churchill\u2019s prime-ministerial country home, Chequers; his wartime retreat, Ditchley, where he and his entourage go when the moon is brightest and the bombing threat is highest; and of course 10 Downing Street in London. Drawing on diaries, original archival documents, and once-secret intelligence reports\u2014some released only recently\u2014Larson provides a new lens on London\u2019s darkest year through the day-to-day experience of Churchill and his family: his wife, Clementine; their youngest daughter, Mary, who chafes against her parents\u2019 wartime protectiveness; their son, Randolph, and his beautiful, unhappy wife, Pamela; Pamela\u2019s illicit lover, a dashing American emissary; and the advisers in Churchill\u2019s \u201cSecret Circle,\u201d to whom he turns in the hardest moments. The Splendid and the Vile takes readers out of today\u2019s political dysfunction and back to a time of true leadership, when, in the face of unrelenting horror, Churchill\u2019s eloquence, courage, and perseverance bound a country, and a family, together."}, {"rank": 4, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0063047985", "primary_isbn13": "9780063047983", "publisher": "HarperOne", "description": "A young woman and her companions travel the deserts of the American West in an orange van.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Nowhere For Very Long", "author": "Brianna Madia", "contributor": "by Brianna Madia", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780063047983.jpg", "book_image_width": 333, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063047985?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0063047985", "isbn13": "9780063047983"}, {"isbn10": "0063048000", "isbn13": "9780063048003"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063047985?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780063047983?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780063047983"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FNOWHERE%2BFOR%2BVERY%2BLONG%2FBrianna%2BMadia%2F9780063047983"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780063047983"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780063047983?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/a97f71ef-4dce-5b64-a34e-c2af6e0db4d7", "list_date": "2022/04/24", "published_data": "2022-05-12", "summary": "N/A"}, {"rank": 5, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 5, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0399588604", "primary_isbn13": "9780399588600", "publisher": "Random House", "description": "The writer of the New York Times column \u201cLife, Interrupted\u201d chronicles her fight with cancer and an impactful road trip.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Between Two Kingdoms", "author": "Suleika Jaouad", "contributor": "by Suleika Jaouad", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780399588587.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0399588582?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0399588582", "isbn13": "9780399588587"}, {"isbn10": "0399588604", "isbn13": "9780399588600"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0399588582?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780399588600?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780399588600"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FBETWEEN%2BTWO%2BKINGDOMS%2FSuleika%2BJaouad%2F9780399588600"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780399588600"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780399588600?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/0bad70d4-77b1-5f84-a0c3-e2842fc98ebf", "list_date": "2022/04/24", "published_data": "2022-03-01", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 A searing, deeply moving memoir of illness and recovery that traces one young woman\u2019s journey from diagnosis to remission to re-entry into \u201cnormal\u201d life\u2014from the author of the Life, Interrupted column in The New York Times ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: The New York Times Book Review, The Washington Post, Bloomberg, The Rumpus, She Reads, Library Journal, Booklist \u2022 \u201cI was immersed for the whole ride and would follow Jaouad anywhere. . . .

Then a trip to the doctor and, a few weeks shy of her twenty-third birthday, a diagnosis: leukemia, with a 35 percent chance of survival. Just like that, the life she had imagined for herself had gone up in flames. By the time Jaouad flew home to New York, she had lost her job, her apartment, and her independence. She would spend much of the next four years in a hospital bed, fighting for her life and chronicling the saga in a column for The New York Times. When Jaouad finally walked out of the cancer ward\u2014after countless rounds of chemo, a clinical trial, and a bone marrow transplant\u2014she was, according to the doctors, cured. But as she would soon learn, a cure is not where the work of healing ends; it\u2019s where it begins. She had spent the past 1,500 days in desperate pursuit of one goal\u2014to survive. And now that she\u2019d done so, she realized that she had no idea how to live. How would she reenter the world and live again? How could she reclaim what had been lost? Jaouad embarked\u2014with her new best friend, Oscar, a scruffy terrier mutt\u2014on a 100-day, 15,000-mile road trip across the country. She set out to meet some of the strangers who had written to her during her years in the hospital: a teenage girl in Florida also recovering from cancer; a teacher in California grieving the death of her son; a death-row inmate in Texas who\u2019d spent his own years confined to a room. What she learned on this trip is that the divide between sick and well is porous, that the vast majority of us will travel back and forth between these realms throughout our lives. Between Two Kingdoms is a profound chronicle of survivorship and a fierce, tender, and inspiring exploration of what it means to begin again."}, {"rank": 6, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "067002516X", "primary_isbn13": "9780670025169", "publisher": "Viking", "description": "A reassessment of World War II as the \"last imperial war\" and a call for a more global perspective on the war.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Blood And Ruins", "author": "Richard Overy", "contributor": "by Richard Overy", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780670025169.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/067002516X?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "067002516X", "isbn13": "9780670025169"}, {"isbn10": "0593489438", "isbn13": "9780593489437"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/067002516X?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780670025169?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780670025169"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FBLOOD%2BAND%2BRUINS%2FRichard%2BOvery%2F9780670025169"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780670025169"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780670025169?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/9d0675f1-3ce1-5676-a91a-7d834e78f7cb", "list_date": "2022/04/24", "published_data": "2022-04-05", "summary": "\u201cMonumental\u2026 [A] vast and detailed study that is surely the finest single-volume history of World War II. Richard Overy has given us a powerful reminder of the horror of war and the threat posed by dictators with dreams of empire.\u201d \u2013 The Wall Street Journal A thought-provoking and original reassessment of World War II, from Britain\u2019s leading military historian A New York Times bestseller Richard Overy sets out in Blood and Ruins to recast the way in which we view the Second World War and its origins and aftermath. As one of Britain\u2019s most decorated and respected World War II historians, he argues that this was the \u201clast imperial war,\u201d with almost a century-long lead-up of global imperial expansion, which reached its peak in the territorial ambitions of Italy, Germany and Japan in the 1930s and early 1940s, before descending into the largest and costliest war in human history and the end, after 1945, of all territorial empires. Overy also argues for a more global perspective on the war, one that looks broader than the typical focus on military conflict between the Allied and Axis states. Above all, Overy explains the bitter cost for those involved in fighting, and the exceptional level of crime and atrocity that marked the war and its protracted aftermath\u2014which extended far beyond 1945. Blood and Ruins is a masterpiece, a new and definitive look at the ultimate struggle over the future of the global order, which will compel us to view the war in novel and unfamiliar ways. Thought-provoking, original and challenging, Blood and Ruins sets out to understand the war anew."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 10, "weeks_on_list": 5, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0063158604", "primary_isbn13": "9780063158603", "publisher": "Morrow", "description": "The former attorney general for George H.W.

In this candid memoir, Barr takes readers behind the scenes during seminal moments of the 1990s, from the LA riots to Pan Am 103 and Iran Contra. Thirty years later, Barr faced an unrelenting barrage of issues, such as Russiagate, the COVID outbreak, civil unrest, the impeachments, and the 2020 election fallout.

An ultimately heartwarming read, Will provides a humane glimpse of the man behind the actor, producer and musician, as he bares all his insecurities and trauma.\u201d \u2014USA Today Winner of the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Achievement One of the most dynamic and globally recognized entertainment forces of our time opens up fully about his life, in a brave and inspiring book that traces his learning curve to a place where outer success, inner happiness, and human connection are aligned. Along the way, Will tells the story in full of one of the most amazing rides through the worlds of music and film that anyone has ever had. Will Smith\u2019s transformation from a West Philadelphia kid to one of the biggest rap stars of his era, and then one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood history, is an epic tale\u2014but it\u2019s only half the story. Will Smith thought, with good reason, that he had won at life: not only was his own success unparalleled, his whole family was at the pinnacle of the entertainment world. Only they didn't see it that way: they felt more like star performers in his circus, a seven-days-a-week job they hadn't signed up for. It turned out Will Smith's education wasn't nearly over. This memoir is the product of a profound journey of self-knowledge, a reckoning with all that your will can get you and all that it can leave behind. Written with the help of Mark Manson, author of the multi-million-copy bestseller The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, Will is the story of how one person mastered his own emotions, written in a way that can help everyone else do the same. Few of us will know the pressure of performing on the world's biggest stages for the highest of stakes, but we can all understand that the fuel that works for one stage of our journey might have to be changed if we want to make it all the way home.

This hilarious, touching, and sometimes tragic book is all about where her fires were lit.\u201d\u2014Emma Thompson ONE OF THE MOST ANTICIPATED BOOKS OF 2022\u2014Entertainment Weekly, PopSugar \u201cThere is nothing stronger than a broken woman who has rebuilt herself,\u201d Hannah Gadsby declared in her show Nanette, a scorching critique of the way society conducts public debates about marginalized communities. When it premiered on Netflix, it left audiences captivated by her blistering honesty and her singular ability to take them from rolling laughter to devastated silence. Ten Steps to Nanette continues Gadsby\u2019s tradition of confounding expectations and norms, properly introducing us to one of the most explosive, formative voices of our time. Gadsby grew up as the youngest of five children in an isolated town in Tasmania, where homosexuality was illegal until 1997. She perceived her childhood as safe and \u201cnormal,\u201d but as she gained an awareness of her burgeoning queerness, the outside world began to undermine the \u201cvulnerably thin veneer\u201d of her existence. After moving to mainland Australia and receiving a degree in art history, Gadsby found herself adrift, working itinerant jobs and enduring years of isolation punctuated by homophobic and sexual violence. At age twenty-seven, without a home or the ability to imagine her own future, she was urged by a friend to enter a stand-up competition. She won, and so began her career in comedy. Gadsby became well known for her self-deprecating, autobiographical humor that made her the butt of her own jokes. But in 2015, as Australia debated the legality of same-sex marriage, Gadsby started to question this mode of storytelling, beginning work on a show that would become \u201cthe most-talked-about, written-about, shared-about comedy act in years\u201d (The New York Times). Harrowing and hilarious, Ten Steps to Nanette traces Gadsby\u2019s growth as a queer person, to her ever-evolving relationship with comedy, and her struggle with late-in-life diagnoses of autism and ADHD, finally arriving at the backbone of Nanette: the renouncement of self-deprecation, the rejection of misogyny, and the moral significance of truth-telling."}, {"rank": 5, "rank_last_week": 11, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593183746", "primary_isbn13": "9780593183748", "publisher": "Dutton Caliber", "description": "The story of four soldiers who received the Medal of Honor for their service during World War II.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Against All Odds", "author": "Alex Kershaw", "contributor": "by Alex Kershaw", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593183748.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593183746?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593183746", "isbn13": "9780593183748"}, {"isbn10": "0593183762", "isbn13": "9780593183762"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593183746?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593183748?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593183748"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FAGAINST%2BALL%2BODDS%2FAlex%2BKershaw%2F9780593183748"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593183748"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593183748?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/971a35f5-a84c-562f-b50d-d172a1e8bcbd", "list_date": "2022/04/17", "published_data": "2022-03-22", "summary": "**The instant New York Times bestseller** The untold story of four of the most decorated soldiers of World War II\u2014all Medal of Honor recipients\u2014from the beaches of French Morocco to Hitler\u2019s own mountaintop fortress, by the national bestselling author of The First Wave \u201cPitch-perfect.\u201d\u2014The Wall Street Journal \u2022 \u201cRiveting.\u201d\u2014World War II magazine \u2022 \u201cAlex Kershaw is the master of putting the reader in the heat of the action.\u201d\u2014Martin Dugard As the Allies raced to defeat Hitler, four men, all in the same unit, earned medal after medal for battlefield heroism.

In 1934, a friend brought fledgling actress Vivien Leigh to see Theatre Royal, where she would first lay eyes on Laurence Olivier in his brilliant performance as Anthony Cavendish. That night, she told her friend that he was the man she was going to marry. There was just one problem: she was already married, and so was he. MADLY is the biography of a marriage, a love affair that still captivates millions, even decades after both actors' deaths. Vivien and Laurence were two of the first truly global celebrities - their fame fueled by the explosive growth of tabloids and television, which helped and hurt them in equal measure. They seemed to have it all and yet, in their own minds, they were doomed, blighted by mental illness which transformed their relationship from the stuff of dreams into a living nightmare. Author Stephen Galloway takes readers on a bewitching journey as he studies their turbulent relationship, one that lasted through some of the world's most unstable decades as the duo fled war, struggled with the loss of fame, and rebuilt their lives again and again."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 4, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593243943", "primary_isbn13": "9780593243947", "publisher": "Random House", "description": "After her husband\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis, the author travels with him to Dignitas, a prominent Swiss right-to-die organization.", "price": "0.00", "title": "In Love", "author": "Amy Bloom", "contributor": "by Amy Bloom", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593243947.jpg", "book_image_width": 332, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593243943?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593243943", "isbn13": "9780593243947"}, {"isbn10": "059324396X", "isbn13": "9780593243961"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593243943?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593243947?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593243947"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FIN%2BLOVE%2FAmy%2BBloom%2F9780593243947"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593243947"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593243947?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/373d877b-315f-51d9-b816-dda68ba9be57", "list_date": "2022/04/10", "published_data": "2022-03-08", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 A powerful memoir of a love that leads two people to find a courageous way to part\u2014and a woman\u2019s struggle to go forward in the face of loss\u2014that \u201cenriches the reader\u2019s life with urgency and gratitude\u201d (The Washington Post) \u201cA pleasure to read . . .

Their world was altered forever when an MRI confirmed what they could no longer ignore: Brian had Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Forced to confront the truth of the diagnosis and its impact on the future he had envisioned, Brian was determined to die on his feet, not live on his knees. Supporting each other in their last journey together, Brian and Amy made the unimaginably difficult and painful decision to go to Dignitas, an organization based in Switzerland that empowers a person to end their own life with dignity and peace. In this heartbreaking and surprising memoir, Bloom sheds light on a part of life we so often shy away from discussing\u2014its ending.

But today's conflict is only the latest in a long history of battles over Ukraine's territory and its existence as a sovereign nation. As the award-winning historian Serhii Plokhy argues in The Gates of Europe, we must examine Ukraine's past in order to understand its present and future. Situated between Central Europe, Russia, and the Middle East, Ukraine was shaped by the empires that used it as a strategic gateway between East and West -- from the Roman and Ottoman empires to the Third Reich and the Soviet Union. For centuries, Ukraine has been a meeting place of various cultures. The mixing of sedentary and nomadic peoples and Christianity and Islam on the steppe borderland produced the class of ferocious warriors known as the Cossacks, for example, while the encounter between the Catholic and Orthodox churches created a religious tradition that bridges Western and Eastern Christianity. Ukraine has also been a home to millions of Jews, serving as the birthplace of Hassidism -- and as one of the killing fields of the Holocaust. Plokhy examines the history of Ukraine's search for its identity through the lives of the major figures in Ukrainian history: Prince Yaroslav the Wise of Kyiv, whose daughter Anna became queen of France; the Cossack ruler Ivan Mazepa, who was immortalized in the poems of Byron and Pushkin; Nikita Khrushchev and his protege-turned-nemesis Leonid Brezhnev, who called Ukraine their home; and the heroes of the Maidan protests of 2013 and 2014, who embody the current struggle over Ukraine's future. As Plokhy explains, today's crisis is a tragic case of history repeating itself, as Ukraine once again finds itself in the center of the battle of global proportions. An authoritative history of this vital country, The Gates of Europe provides a unique insight into the origins of the most dangerous international crisis since the end of the Cold War."}, {"rank": 4, "rank_last_week": 12, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1620976811", "primary_isbn13": "9781620976814", "publisher": "New Press", "description": "The Nation\u2019s legal analyst and justice correspondent posits ways to protect the rights of women and people of color.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Allow Me To Retort", "author": "Elie Mystal", "contributor": "by Elie Mystal", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781620976814.jpg", "book_image_width": 324, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1620976811?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1620976811", "isbn13": "9781620976814"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1620976811?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781620976814?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781620976814"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FALLOW%2BME%2BTO%2BRETORT%2FElie%2BMystal%2F9781620976814"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781620976814"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781620976814?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/bbb900b5-8381-5fcc-9960-b927895ce86a", "list_date": "2022/03/27", "published_data": "2022-01-11", "summary": "The MSNBC commentator and legal editor of The Nation turns his razor-sharp wit and legal acumen on our founding document and finds it to be . . . well, awfully white \"Mystal possesses a vocabulary and penchant for stringing words together that makes other writers envious. He can bring you to your knees with the power of the written word.\" --Donna McGill, Lawcrossing.com According to commentator and lawyer Elie Mystal, Republicans are wrong when they tell you the First Amendment allows religious fundamentalists to discriminate against gay people who like cake. They're wrong when they tell you the Second Amendment protects the right to own a private arsenal. They're wrong when they say the death penalty isn't cruel or unusual punishment, and they're wrong when they tell you we have no legal remedies for the scourge of police violence against people of color. In fact, Mystal argues, Republicans are wrong about the law almost all of the time, and now, instead of talking about this on cable news, Mystal explains why in his first book. Allow Me to Retort is an easily digestible argument primer, offered so that people can tell the Republicans in their own lives why they are wrong. Mystal brings his trademark humor, snark, and legal expertise to topics as crucial to our politics as gerrymandering and voter suppression, and explains why legal concepts such as the right to privacy and substantive due process are constantly under attack from the very worst judges conservatives can pack onto the courts. You don't need to be a legal scholar to grasp how stop-and-frisk is an unconstitutional policy of racial discrimination. You just need to read Mystal's book to understand that the Fourteenth Amendment once made the white supremacist policies adopted by the modern Republican Party illegal--and it can do so again if we let it."}, {"rank": 6, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1728247985", "primary_isbn13": "9781728247984", "publisher": "Sourcebooks", "description": "The pop culture podcast host recounts growing up as a closeted gay kid in Ohio during the 1990s.", "price": "0.00", "title": "How Do I Un-Remember This?", "author": "Danny Pellegrino", "contributor": "by Danny Pellegrino", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781728247984.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1728247985?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1728247985", "isbn13": "9781728247984"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1728247985?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781728247984?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781728247984"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FHOW%2BDO%2BI%2BUN-REMEMBER%2BTHIS%253F%2FDanny%2BPellegrino%2F9781728247984"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781728247984"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781728247984?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/20caae55-4281-508c-8959-8b38398256e8", "list_date": "2022/03/27", "published_data": "2022-03-08", "summary": "From the host of Everything Iconicwith Danny Pellegrino comes a collection of stories you'll be glad didn't happen to you. Think of the most embarrassing thing that's every happened to you. Was it the time your high school cheer squad taunted you in front of the entire town? Was it the time your best friend's mom caught you streaking in all your naked, self-conscious glory? What about the time you accidentally threw a tooth at your drycleaner or took an urn into Kohl's for some holiday shopping? For Danny Pellegrino, the answer is all of the above. Growing up as a closeted gay kid in small-town Ohio wasn't easy, and Danny has the stories to prove it. But coming of age in the 90s still meant something magical to Danny. The music, film, and celebrity moments of his youth were truly iconic, and his love for all things pop culture connected him to a world larger than the one he knew in the suburban Midwest. And through all the pains of growing up, Danny could always look to that world for hope--whether that meant bingeing The Nannyuntil he had the confidence of Fran Fine, belting out Brandy songs until his heartaches were healed, or watching semi-clothed Ryan Phillippe scenes until his cheeks burned from blushing. With refreshing honesty and jaw-dropping absurdity, Danny invites readers to experience his most formative moments in life--from his hometown in Ohio to his hit podcast and career in entertainment today. How Do I Un-Remember This?is an unfiltered and all-too-relatable glimpse into Danny's life and the heartfelt and hilarious moments that shaped it. Although he wouldn't change them for the world, these stories are--unfortunately--true."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1984824341", "primary_isbn13": "9781984824349", "publisher": "Crown", "description": "The troubles that beset an expedition to Antarctica, led by the Belgian commandant Adrien de Gerlache, in 1897.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Madhouse At The End Of The Earth", "author": "Julian Sancton", "contributor": "by Julian Sancton", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781984824349.jpg", "book_image_width": 325, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1984824341?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1984824341", "isbn13": "9781984824349"}, {"isbn10": "198482435X", "isbn13": "9781984824356"}, {"isbn10": "1984824333", "isbn13": "9781984824332"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1984824341?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781984824349?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781984824349"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FMADHOUSE%2BAT%2BTHE%2BEND%2BOF%2BTHE%2BEARTH%2FJulian%2BSancton%2F9781984824349"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781984824349"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781984824349?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/1f9779dc-ad6b-5b93-b980-981b2d07bb98", "list_date": "2022/03/27", "published_data": "2022-02-22", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 The \u201cexquisitely researched and deeply engrossing\u201d (The New York Times) true survival story of an early polar expedition that went terribly awry\u2014with the ship frozen in ice and the crew trapped inside for the entire sunless, Antarctic winter \u201cThe energy of the narrative never flags. . . . Sancton has produced a thriller.\u201d\u2014The Wall Street Journal In August 1897, the young Belgian commandant Adrien de Gerlache set sail for a three-year expedition aboard the good ship Belgica with dreams of glory. His destination was the uncharted end of the earth: the icy continent of Antarctica. But de Gerlache\u2019s plans to be first to the magnetic South Pole would swiftly go awry. After a series of costly setbacks, the commandant faced two bad options: turn back in defeat and spare his men the devastating Antarctic winter, or recklessly chase fame by sailing deeper into the freezing waters. De Gerlache sailed on, and soon the Belgica was stuck fast in the icy hold of the Bellingshausen Sea. When the sun set on the magnificent polar landscape one last time, the ship\u2019s occupants were condemned to months of endless night. In the darkness, plagued by a mysterious illness and besieged by monotony, they descended into madness. In Madhouse at the End of the Earth, Julian Sancton unfolds an epic story of adventure and horror for the ages. As the Belgica\u2019s men teetered on the brink, de Gerlache relied increasingly on two young officers whose friendship had blossomed in captivity: the expedition\u2019s lone American, Dr. Frederick Cook\u2014half genius, half con man\u2014whose later infamy would overshadow his brilliance on the Belgica; and the ship\u2019s first mate, soon-to-be legendary Roald Amundsen, even in his youth the storybook picture of a sailor. Together, they would plan a last-ditch, nearly certain-to-fail escape from the ice\u2014one that would either etch their names in history or doom them to a terrible fate at the ocean\u2019s bottom. Drawing on the diaries and journals of the Belgica\u2019s crew and with exclusive access to the ship\u2019s logbook, Sancton brings novelistic flair to a story of human extremes, one so remarkable that even today NASA studies it for research on isolation for future missions to Mars. Equal parts maritime thriller and gothic horror, Madhouse at the End of the Earth is an unforgettable journey into the deep."}, {"rank": 3, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0399180516", "primary_isbn13": "9780399180514", "publisher": "Random House", "description": "The actor and writer, known for his work in sketch comedy and dramatic roles, charts his path.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Comedy Comedy Comedy Drama", "author": "Bob Odenkirk", "contributor": "by Bob Odenkirk", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780399180514.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0399180516?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0399180516", "isbn13": "9780399180514"}, {"isbn10": "0399180524", "isbn13": "9780399180521"}, {"isbn10": "1984885286", "isbn13": "9781984885289"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0399180516?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780399180514?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780399180514"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FCOMEDY%2BCOMEDY%2BCOMEDY%2BDRAMA%2FBob%2BOdenkirk%2F9780399180514"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780399180514"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780399180514?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/c4d8ba22-0a33-5418-a2f4-4bdfd2b0e301", "list_date": "2022/03/20", "published_data": "2022-03-01", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 In this \u201cessential\u201d (Entertainment Weekly), \u201chilarious\u201d (AV Club) memoir, the star of Mr. Show, Breaking Bad, and Better Call Saul opens up about the highs and lows of showbiz, his cult status as a comedy writer, and what it\u2019s like to reinvent himself as an action film ass-kicker at fifty. \u201cI can\u2019t think of another entertainer who has improbably morphed so many times, and all through real genius and determination.\u201d\u2014Conan O\u2019Brien ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: The New Yorker Bob Odenkirk\u2019s career is inexplicable.

One morning in late 2017, New York Times columnist Frank Bruni woke up with strangely blurred vision. He wondered at first if some goo or gunk had worked its way into his right eye. But this was no fleeting annoyance, no fixable inconvenience. Overnight, a rare stroke had cut off blood to one of his optic nerves, rendering him functionally blind in that eye\u2014forever. And he soon learned from doctors that the same disorder could ravage his left eye, too. He could lose his sight altogether. In The Beauty of Dusk, Bruni hauntingly recounts his adjustment to this daunting reality, a medical and spiritual odyssey that involved not only reappraising his own priorities but also reaching out to, and gathering wisdom from, longtime friends and new acquaintances who had navigated their own traumas and afflictions. The result is a poignant, probing, and ultimately uplifting examination of the limits that all of us inevitably encounter, the lenses through which we choose to evaluate them and the tools we have for perseverance. Bruni\u2019s world blurred in one sense, as he experienced his first real inklings that the day isn\u2019t forever and that light inexorably fades, but sharpened in another.

Renowned writer Meghan O\u2019Rourke delivers a revelatory investigation into this elusive category of \u201cinvisible\u201d illness that encompasses autoimmune diseases, post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, and now long COVID, synthesizing the personal and the universal to help all of us through this new frontier. Drawing on her own medical experiences as well as a decade of interviews with doctors, patients, researchers, and public health experts, O\u2019Rourke traces the history of Western definitions of illness, and reveals how inherited ideas of cause, diagnosis, and treatment have led us to ignore a host of hard-to-understand medical conditions, ones that resist easy description or simple cures. And as America faces this health crisis of extraordinary proportions, the populations most likely to be neglected by our institutions include women, the working class, and people of color. Blending lyricism and erudition, candor and empathy, O\u2019Rourke brings together her deep and disparate talents and roles as critic, journalist, poet, teacher, and patient, synthesizing the personal and universal into one monumental project arguing for a seismic shift in our approach to disease. The Invisible Kingdom offers hope for the sick, solace and insight for their loved ones, and a radical new understanding of our bodies and our health."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593320522", "primary_isbn13": "9780593320525", "publisher": "Knopf", "description": "A memoir by the four-time Tony Award\u2013winning actor and playwright.", "price": "0.00", "title": "I Was Better Last Night", "author": "Harvey Fierstein", "contributor": "by Harvey Fierstein", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593320525.jpg", "book_image_width": 342, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593320522?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593320522", "isbn13": "9780593320525"}, {"isbn10": "0593320530", "isbn13": "9780593320532"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593320522?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593320525?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593320525"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FI%2BWAS%2BBETTER%2BLAST%2BNIGHT%2FHarvey%2BFierstein%2F9780593320525"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593320525"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593320525?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/8816e9b6-85ca-50ae-9ad5-9548c7000b14", "list_date": "2022/03/20", "published_data": "2022-03-01", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLER \u2022 A poignant and hilarious memoir from the cultural icon, gay rights activist, and four-time Tony Award\u2013winning actor and playwright, revealing never-before-told stories of his personal struggles and conflict, of sex and romance, and of his fabled career Harvey Fierstein\u2019s legendary career has transported him from community theater in Brooklyn, to the lights of Broadway, to the absurd excesses of Hollywood and back. He\u2019s received accolades and awards for acting in and/or writing an incredible string of hit plays, films, and TV shows: Hairspray, Fiddler on the Roof, Mrs. Doubtfire, Independence Day, Cheers, La Cage Aux Folles, Torch Song Trilogy, Newsies, and Kinky Boots. While he has never shied away from the spotlight, Mr. Fierstein says that even those closest to him have never heard most of the tales\u2014of personal struggles and conflict, of sex and romance, of his fabled career\u2014revealed in these wildly entertaining pages. I Was Better Last Night bares the inner life of this eccentric nonconforming child from his roots in 1952 Brooklyn, to the experimental worlds of Andy Warhol and the Theatre of the Ridiculous, to the gay rights movements of the seventies and the tumultuous AIDS crisis of the eighties, through decades of addiction, despair, and ultimate triumph. Mr. Fierstein\u2019s candid recollections provide a rich window into downtown New York City life, gay culture, and the evolution of theater (of which he has been a defining figure), as well as a moving account of his family\u2019s journey of acceptance. I Was Better Last Night is filled with wisdom gained, mistakes made, and stories that come together to describe an astonishingly colorful and meaningful life. Lucky for us all, his unique and recognizable voice is as engaging, outrageously funny, and vulnerable on the page."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 12, "weeks_on_list": 4, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0735217955", "primary_isbn13": "9780735217959", "publisher": "Penguin Press", "description": "An overview of the cultural and historical impact of the 1990s.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Nineties", "author": "Chuck Klosterman", "contributor": "by Chuck Klosterman", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780735217959.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0735217955?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0735217955", "isbn13": "9780735217959"}, {"isbn10": "0735217971", "isbn13": "9780735217973"}, {"isbn10": "0593555546", "isbn13": "9780593555545"}, {"isbn10": "0735217963", "isbn13": "9780735217966"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0735217955?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780735217959?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780735217959"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BNINETIES%2FChuck%2BKlosterman%2F9780735217959"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780735217959"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780735217959?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/ab9a9cf3-1f74-5a1e-9daf-7eeedc4756c4", "list_date": "2022/03/20", "published_data": "2022-02-08", "summary": "An instant New York Times bestseller! From the bestselling author of But What if We\u2019re Wrong, a wise and funny reckoning with the decade that gave us slacker/grunge irony about the sin of trying too hard, during the greatest shift in human consciousness of any decade in American history. It was long ago, but not as long as it seems: The Berlin Wall fell and the Twin Towers collapsed. In between, one presidential election was allegedly decided by Ross Perot while another was plausibly decided by Ralph Nader. In the beginning, almost every name and address was listed in a phone book, and everyone answered their landlines because you didn\u2019t know who it was. By the end, exposing someone\u2019s address was an act of emotional violence, and nobody picked up their new cell phone if they didn\u2019t know who it was. The 90s brought about a revolution in the human condition we\u2019re still groping to understand. Happily, Chuck Klosterman is more than up to the job. Beyond epiphenomena like \"Cop Killer\" and Titanic and Zima, there were wholesale shifts in how society was perceived: the rise of the internet, pre-9/11 politics, and the paradoxical belief that nothing was more humiliating than trying too hard. Pop culture accelerated without the aid of a machine that remembered everything, generating an odd comfort in never being certain about anything. On a 90\u2019s Thursday night, more people watched any random episode of Seinfeld than the finale of Game of Thrones. But nobody thought that was important; if you missed it, you simply missed it. It was the last era that held to the idea of a true, hegemonic mainstream before it all began to fracture, whether you found a home in it or defined yourself against it. In The Nineties, Chuck Klosterman makes a home in all of it: the film, the music, the sports, the TV, the politics, the changes regarding race and class and sexuality, the yin/yang of Oprah and Alan Greenspan. In perhaps no other book ever written would a sentence like, \u201cThe video for \u2018Smells Like Teen Spirit\u2019 was not more consequential than the reunification of Germany\u201d make complete sense. Chuck Klosterman has written a multi-dimensional masterpiece, a work of synthesis so smart and delightful that future historians might well refer to this entire period as Klostermanian."}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 4, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0063030942", "primary_isbn13": "9780063030947", "publisher": "Harper", "description": "Twenty-five young inmates of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp made garments for elite Nazi women.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Dressmakers Of Auschwitz", "author": "Lucy Adlington", "contributor": "by Lucy Adlington", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780063030930.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063030934?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0063030934", "isbn13": "9780063030930"}, {"isbn10": "0063030942", "isbn13": "9780063030947"}, {"isbn10": "0063030926", "isbn13": "9780063030923"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063030934?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780063030947?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780063030947"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BDRESSMAKERS%2BOF%2BAUSCHWITZ%2FLucy%2BAdlington%2F9780063030947"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780063030947"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780063030947?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/a36a5b6c-f9c2-57a7-b3a8-bcc6e0f74720", "list_date": "2022/03/13", "published_data": "2021-09-14", "summary": "A powerful chronicle of the women who used their sewing skills to survive the Holocaust, stitching beautiful clothes at an extraordinary fashion workshop created within one of the most notorious WWII death camps.

In the early hours of June 17, 1972, a security guard named Frank Wills entered six words into the log book of the Watergate office complex that would change the course of history: 1:47 AM Found tape on doors; call police. The five \u200bmen\u2014Virgilio Gonzalez, Bernard Baker, James McCord, Eugenio Martinez, and Frank Sturgis\u2014arrested and charged with attempted burglary that night kicked off the biggest scandal in American politics. Over the next two years, that single thwarted break-in would lead to dozens more arrests, an alleged kidnapping, FBI and congressional investigations, a Senate hearing, and bombshell testimonies from the highest levels of political power that ultimately would reveal a cover-up, sink a vice-president and a half-dozen Cabinet officials, lead to the jailing of an FBI director, end a presidency, and alter our views of moral authority and leadership. Watergate defined a decade, and a nation. And yet, recent revelations like the release of more Nixon tapes and the identity of \u201cDeep Throat\u201d himself, means that the full story has never been told from start to finish. Now, in Watergate, award-winning journalist and bestselling author Garrett M. Graff explores the full sweep of the scandal that would come to define all others, from the release of The Pentagon Papers in 1971\u2014the first signs of trouble for the White House\u2014and the 1972 DNC break-in to the denials, trials, hearings, and eventual downfall of the Nixon Administration three years later\u2014the implications of which we still feel today. Watergate, Graff shows, is a much bigger and much weirder story than America remembers. Along the way, he introduces a vibrant cast of characters, including the psychologically tortured President and his doomed inner circle, special prosecutors Archibald Cox and Leon Jaworski, the Congressional committees led by Sam Ervin and Peter Rodino, groundbreaking reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, and Mark Felt, an Associate Director of the FBI who would conceal his identity for decades behind the name \u201cDeep Throat,\u201d as well a host of others whose involvement has been forgotten\u2014from Yankees owner George Steinbrenner to a young impeachment aide named Hillary Rodham.

Everybody has regrets, Daniel H. Pink explains in The Power of Regret. They\u2019re a universal and healthy part of being human. And understanding how regret works can help us make smarter decisions, perform better at work and school, and bring greater meaning to our lives. Drawing on research in social psychology, neuroscience, and biology, Pink debunks the myth of the \u201cno regrets\u201d philosophy of life. And using the largest sampling of American attitudes about regret ever conducted as well as his own World Regret Survey\u2014which has collected regrets from more than 15,000 people in 105 countries\u2014he lays out the four core regrets that each of us has. These deep regrets offer compelling insights into how we live and how we can find a better path forward. As he did in his bestsellers Drive, When, and A Whole New Mind, Pink lays out a dynamic new way of thinking about regret and frames his ideas in ways that are clear, accessible, and pragmatic. Packed with true stories of people's regrets as well as practical takeaways for reimagining regret as a positive force, The Power of Regret shows how we can live richer, more engaged lives."}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0374139946", "primary_isbn13": "9780374139940", "publisher": "MCD", "description": "The life, work and cultural influence of the late hip-hop producer J Dilla.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Dilla Time", "author": "Dan Charnas", "contributor": "by Dan Charnas", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780374139940.jpg", "book_image_width": 333, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0374139946?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0374139946", "isbn13": "9780374139940"}, {"isbn10": "0374721653", "isbn13": "9780374721657"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0374139946?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780374139940?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780374139940"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FDILLA%2BTIME%2FDan%2BCharnas%2F9780374139940"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780374139940"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780374139940?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/cbef26aa-36cf-56ce-908d-41eee9077af1", "list_date": "2022/02/20", "published_data": "2022-02", "summary": "\"Equal parts musicology, biography, and cultural history, Dilla Time chronicles the invention of a new kind of beat by the most underappreciated musical genius of our time\"--"}, {"rank": 9, "rank_last_week": 5, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "035856736X", "primary_isbn13": "9780358567363", "publisher": "Harvest", "description": "The actress and TV personality describes her personal setbacks and difficult journey to self-acceptance.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Enough Already", "author": "Valerie Bertinelli", "contributor": "by Valerie Bertinelli", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780358567363.jpg", "book_image_width": 333, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/035856736X?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "035856736X", "isbn13": "9780358567363"}, {"isbn10": "0358567327", "isbn13": "9780358567325"}, {"isbn10": "0358629241", "isbn13": "9780358629245"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/035856736X?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780358567363?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780358567363"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FENOUGH%2BALREADY%2FValerie%2BBertinelli%2F9780358567363"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780358567363"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780358567363?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/bff4d3ee-1317-5563-87cb-fd1d6f9f24af", "list_date": "2022/02/20", "published_data": "2022-01-18", "summary": "Beloved actress and New York Times best-selling author Valerie Bertinelli returns with a heartfelt look at turning sixty, the futility of finding happiness in numbers on a scale, learning to love herself the way she is today, and tips for a healthier outlook on life.

She shares personal stories that many women will relate to from her past decade: hitting her fifties, taking care of her dying mother, the evolving relationship with her husband, a career change, her relationship with food, and the battle to believe in herself as she is. Despite her success receiving Emmys for her Food Network show and critical praise for her books and cookbook, Bertinelli still judged herself harshly if she gained a pound or showed too many wrinkles. But after her mother died, she found an old recipe box with notes of the strong women that came before her, reminding her that she has to find out who she is and take care of herself. Saying, \"enough already!\" Bertinelli set out on a journey to love herself and see that perfection is not the goal; it's the joy we can find every day in our lives, our loved ones, and the food we share.

Even those who have never lived there, who have never even been there, can rattle off a list of signifiers that define the South for them: Gone with the Wind, the Civil War, the Ku Klux Klan, cotillions, plantations, football, Jim Crow, and, of course, slavery. For those who live outside the region, the South is very much about the profound difference between \"us\" and \"them.\" In South to America, Imani Perry shows in detail by infinitely careful detail that the meaning of American is inextricably linked with the South, and if we are American, we are all at least a little bit Southern. In looking at the American South through a historic, personal, and anecdotal lens, Perry argues that the South is in fact the nation's heartland. The formation of our country, our wealth, and our politics have always pivoted around the resource-rich region. A native of Alabama but raised in the North, Perry returns to the South--the place she has always called home--traveling through its cities and their cultural formations, studying its historical figures and institutions and the natural settings from which they sprang. Seeing the South as familiar and anew, Perry goes on a journey that brings her in contact with Southerners from all walks of life. She renders them with sensitivity and honesty, in addition to sharing her thoughts about a troubling history and the ritual humiliations and joys that characterize so much of Southern life. This is the story of a woman going home--a Black woman and a Southern home--at a time when ideas of how the South should be are rising once again. South to America is an assertion that if we do indeed want to build a more humane future for the United States, we must center our concern below the Mason-Dixon Line."}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 14, "weeks_on_list": 16, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1982168013", "primary_isbn13": "9781982168018", "publisher": "Gallery", "description": "The award-winning actor reflects on his career, Italian-American heritage, meals and mishaps.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Taste", "author": "Stanley Tucci", "contributor": "by Stanley Tucci", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781982168018.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982168013?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1982168013", "isbn13": "9781982168018"}, {"isbn10": "198216803X", "isbn13": "9781982168032"}, {"isbn10": "1797123475", "isbn13": "9781797123479"}, {"isbn10": "1797123491", "isbn13": "9781797123493"}, {"isbn10": "1432891359", "isbn13": "9781432891350"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982168013?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781982168018?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781982168018"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTASTE%2FStanley%2BTucci%2F9781982168018"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781982168018"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781982168018?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/71e4d06f-0b48-5f21-93a5-5ed7f4e69eae", "list_date": "2022/02/13", "published_data": "2021-10-05", "summary": "\"From award-winning actor and food obsessive Stanley Tucci comes an intimate ... memoir of life in and out of the kitchen\"--"}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 5, "weeks_on_list": 4, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0063209780", "primary_isbn13": "9780063209787", "publisher": "Harper", "description": "The Maryland congressman describes leading the impeachment effort against the former president shortly after his son\u2019s death by suicide and the insurrection at the Capitol.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Unthinkable", "author": "Jamie Raskin", "contributor": "by Jamie Raskin", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780063209787.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063209780?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0063209780", "isbn13": "9780063209787"}, {"isbn10": "0063209802", "isbn13": "9780063209800"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063209780?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780063209787?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780063209787"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FUNTHINKABLE%2FJamie%2BRaskin%2F9780063209787"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780063209787"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780063209787?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/3d464733-2e01-5c6a-bfe5-9b47461d662b", "list_date": "2022/02/13", "published_data": "2022-01-04", "summary": "Congressman Jamie Raskin tells the story of the forty-five days at the start of 2021 that permanently changed his life - and his family's - as he confronted the painful loss of his son to suicide, lived through the violent insurrection in our nation's Capitol, and led the impeachment effort to hold President Trump accountable for inciting the political violence.

Herring delves into the origin, evolution, and eventual demise of the iconic club in eye-opening detail.

A far-right militia plots to kidnap the governor of Michigan and try her for treason. An armed mob of Trump supporters and conspiracy theorists storms the U.S. Capitol. Are these isolated incidents? Or is this the start of something bigger? Barbara F. Walter has spent her career studying civil conflict in places like Iraq, Ukraine, and Sri Lanka, but now she has become increasingly worried about her own country. Perhaps surprisingly, both autocracies and healthy democracies are largely immune from civil war; it\u2019s the countries in the middle ground that are most vulnerable. And this is where more and more countries, including the United States, are finding themselves today. Over the last two decades, the number of active civil wars around the world has almost doubled. Walter reveals the warning signs\u2014where wars tend to start, who initiates them, what triggers them\u2014and why some countries tip over into conflict while others remain stable. Drawing on the latest international research and lessons from over twenty countries, Walter identifies the crucial risk factors, from democratic backsliding to factionalization and the politics of resentment. A civil war today won\u2019t look like America in the 1860s, Russia in the 1920s, or Spain in the 1930s. It will begin with sporadic acts of violence and terror, accelerated by social media. It will sneak up on us and leave us wondering how we could have been so blind. In this urgent and insightful book, Walter redefines civil war for a new age, providing the framework we need to confront the danger we now face\u2014and the knowledge to stop it before it\u2019s too late."}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1627791507", "primary_isbn13": "9781627791502", "publisher": "Holt", "description": "The Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist details his journey of self-education in the newsrooms of Washington, D.C.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Chasing History", "author": "Carl Bernstein", "contributor": "by Carl Bernstein", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781627791502.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1627791507?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1627791507", "isbn13": "9781627791502"}, {"isbn10": "1627791515", "isbn13": "9781627791519"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1627791507?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781627791502?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781627791502"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FCHASING%2BHISTORY%2FCarl%2BBernstein%2F9781627791502"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781627791502"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781627791502?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/a12a5ef0-80cd-5cf0-91d5-c25984421b41", "list_date": "2022/01/30", "published_data": "2021-05-18", "summary": "The Pulitzer Prize-winning co-author of All the President\u2019s Men\u2014the chronicle of the investigative report about the Watergate break-in and resultant political scandal which led to President Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation\u2014recalls his formative years as a teenage newspaper reporter in JFK\u2019s Washington\u2014a tale of adventures, scrapes, clever escapes, and the opportunity of a lifetime. \u201cCarl Bernstein, Washington Star.\u201d With these words, the sixteen-year-old senior at Montgomery Blair High School set himself apart from the high school crowd and set himself on a track that would define his life. Carl Bernstein was far from the best student in his class\u2014in fact, he was in danger of not graduating at all\u2014but he had a talent for writing, a burning desire to know things that other people didn\u2019t, and a flair for being in the right place at the right time. Those qualities got him inside the newsroom at the Washington Star, the afternoon paper in the nation\u2019s capital, in the summer of 1960, a pivotal time for America, for Washington, D.C., and for a young man in a hurry on the cusp of adulthood. Chasing History opens up the world of the early 1960s as Bernstein experienced it, chasing after grisly crimes with the paper\u2019s police reporter, gathering colorful details at a John F. Kennedy campaign rally, running afoul of union rules, and confronting racial tensions as the civil rights movement gained strength. We learn alongside him as he comes to understand the life of a newspaperman, and we share his pride as he hunts down information, gets his first byline, and discovers that he has a talent for the job after all. By turns exhilarating, funny, tense, and poignant, Chasing History shows us a country coming into its own maturity along with young Carl Bernstein, and when he strikes out on his own after five years at the Star, his hard-won knowledge and experience feels like ours as well."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1368042007", "primary_isbn13": "9781368042000", "publisher": "Hyperion Avenue", "description": "The chief meteorologist for ABC News shares some of her childhood difficulties and ongoing struggles.", "price": "0.00", "title": "A Little Closer To Home", "author": "Ginger Zee", "contributor": "by Ginger Zee", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781368042000.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1368042007?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1368042007", "isbn13": "9781368042000"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1368042007?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781368042000?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781368042000"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FA%2BLITTLE%2BCLOSER%2BTO%2BHOME%2FGinger%2BZee%2F9781368042000"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781368042000"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781368042000?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/fad0b4d2-1bac-56c2-b73f-d3c11288fa5c", "list_date": "2022/01/30", "published_data": "2021-10-12", "summary": "In Ginger Zee's follow-up to the bestselling Natural Disaster, the ABC chief meteorologist takes readers on a much deeper journey of self discovery.

But Ginger tells us, Natural Disaster was \"Ginger Lite\" and only scratched the surface. In this moving follow-up, Ginger shares her truest self. She spent most of her life shielding her vulnerabilities from the world all while being a professional people pleaser. Her stormy childhood, her ongoing struggles with crippling depression, her suicide attempts, and many other life experiences will resonate with readers who are likely to see themselves along the way. In spite of its serious subject matter, Ginger's positive, life-affirming outlook comes through loud and clear.

Trump to President Joseph R. Biden Jr. stands as one of the most dangerous periods in American history. But as # 1 internationally bestselling author Bob Woodward and acclaimed reporter Robert Costa reveal for the first time, it was far more than just a domestic political crisis. Woodward and Costa interviewed more than 200 people at the center of the turmoil, resulting in more than 6,000 pages of transcripts\u2014and a spellbinding and definitive portrait of a nation on the brink. This classic study of Washington takes readers deep inside the Trump White House, the Biden White House, the 2020 campaign, and the Pentagon and Congress, with vivid, eyewitness accounts of what really happened. Peril is supplemented throughout with never-before-seen material from secret orders, transcripts of confidential calls, diaries, emails, meeting notes and other personal and government records, making for an unparalleled history. It is also the first inside look at Biden\u2019s presidency as he faces the challenges of a lifetime: the continuing deadly pandemic and millions of Americans facing soul-crushing economic pain, all the while navigating a bitter and disabling partisan divide, a world rife with threats, and the hovering, dark shadow of the former president. \u201cWe have much to do in this winter of peril,\u201d Biden declared at his inauguration, an event marked by a nerve-wracking security alert and the threat of domestic terrorism. Peril is the extraordinary story of the end of one presidency and the beginning of another, and represents the culmination of Bob Woodward\u2019s news-making trilogy on the Trump presidency, along with Fear and Rage. And it is the beginning of a collaboration with fellow Washington Post reporter Robert Costa that will remind readers of Woodward\u2019s coverage, with Carl Bernstein, of President Richard M.

Few names are as synonymous with wealth and glamour as \"Vanderbilt.\" When Cornelius Vanderbilt, the teenaged son of a ferryman in New York Harbor who was born at the end of the eighteenth century, decided to go into business on his own, few would have believed that within six decades he would epitomize American wealth, magnate of a shipping and railroad empire that made him the richest man in the country. In the wake of his death in 1877, Cornelius's heirs bitterly fought over his estate, sowing familial discord that would never fully heal. The generations of Vanderbilts who followed lived lives of unimaginable excess, steeped in tides of success and failure. By 2018, when the last Vanderbilt left the Breakers--the summer estate in Newport, Rhode Island, his grandson and namesake Cornelius Vanderbilt II built--the family would have been unrecognizable to the Commodore. Now, the Commodore's great-great-great-grandson, Anderson Cooper, joins with historian Katherine Howe to explore the story of his legendary family and their remarkable influence. Cooper and Howe breathe life into the ancestors who built the family's empire, basked in the Commodore's wealth, hosted lavish galas, and became synonymous with unfettered American capitalism and high society. Moving from the hardscrabble wharves of Staten Island to the lavish drawing rooms of Gilded Age Fifth Avenue, from the ornate summer palaces of Newport to the courts Europe, Cooper and Howe wryly recount the triumphs and tragedies of an American family unlike any other. Drawing on never-before-seen documents and told from a unique insider's viewpoint, this is a rollicking, quintessentially American history as remarkable as the family it so vividly captures."}, {"rank": 6, "rank_last_week": 7, "weeks_on_list": 8, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0525540571", "primary_isbn13": "9780525540571", "publisher": "Sentinel", "description": "The Fox News host gives an account of the relationship between Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The President And The Freedom Fighter", "author": "Brian Kilmeade", "contributor": "by Brian Kilmeade", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780525540571.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525540571?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0525540571", "isbn13": "9780525540571"}, {"isbn10": "0525540601", "isbn13": "9780525540601"}, {"isbn10": "052554058X", "isbn13": "9780525540588"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525540571?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780525540571?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780525540571"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BPRESIDENT%2BAND%2BTHE%2BFREEDOM%2BFIGHTER%2FBrian%2BKilmeade%2F9780525540571"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780525540571"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780525540571?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/aaf9fd71-067b-5489-ad91-bbf199ceff0b", "list_date": "2022/01/09", "published_data": "2021-11-02", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER The New York Times bestselling author of George Washington's Secret Six and Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates turns to two other heroes of the nation: Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. In The President and the Freedom Fighter, Brian Kilmeade tells the little-known story of how two American heroes moved from strong disagreement to friendship, and in the process changed the entire course of history. Abraham Lincoln was White, born impoverished on a frontier farm. Frederick Douglass was Black, a child of slavery who had risked his life escaping to freedom in the North. Neither man had a formal education, and neither had had an easy path to influence. No one would have expected them to become friends\u2014or to transform the country. But Lincoln and Douglass believed in their nation\u2019s greatness. They were determined to make the grand democratic experiment live up to its ideals. Lincoln\u2019s problem: he knew it was time for slavery to go, but how fast could the country change without being torn apart? And would it be possible to get rid of slavery while keeping America\u2019s Constitution intact? Douglass said no, that the Constitution was irredeemably corrupted by slavery\u2014and he wanted Lincoln to move quickly. Sharing little more than the conviction that slavery was wrong, the two men\u2019s paths eventually converged. Over the course of the Civil War, they\u2019d endure bloodthirsty mobs, feverish conspiracies, devastating losses on the battlefield, and a growing firestorm of unrest that would culminate on the fields of Gettysburg. As he did in George Washington's Secret Six, Kilmeade has transformed this nearly forgotten slice of history into a dramatic story that will keep you turning the pages to find out how these two heroes, through their principles and patience, not only changed each other, but made America truly free for all."}, {"rank": 7, "rank_last_week": 11, "weeks_on_list": 8, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593236319", "primary_isbn13": "9780593236314", "publisher": "Crown", "description": "Conversations between the 44th president and the multiple award-winning musician on a range of topics.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Renegades", "author": "Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen", "contributor": "by Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593236314.jpg", "book_image_width": 498, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593236319?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593236319", "isbn13": "9780593236314"}, {"isbn10": "0593236327", "isbn13": "9780593236321"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593236319?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593236314?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593236314"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FRENEGADES%2FBarack%2BObama%2Band%2BBruce%2BSpringsteen%2F9780593236314"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593236314"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593236314?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/78e5d2de-a0bf-5ecd-915b-dffe79c6c51b", "list_date": "2022/01/09", "published_data": "2021-10-26", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 Two longtime friends share an intimate and urgent conversation about life, music, and their enduring love of America, with all its challenges and contradictions, in this stunningly produced expansion of their groundbreaking Higher Ground podcast, featuring more than 350 photographs, exclusive bonus content, and never-before-seen archival material.

Life, however, often takes turns we do not see coming. Patchett ponders this truth in these wise essays that afford a fresh and intimate look into her mind and heart. At the center of These Precious Days is the title essay, a surprising and moving meditation on an unexpected friendship that explores \"what it means to be seen, to find someone with whom you can be your best and most complete self.\" When Patchett chose an early galley of actor and producer Tom Hanks' short story collection to read one night before bed, she had no idea that this single choice would be life changing. It would introduce her to a remarkable woman--Tom's brilliant assistant Sooki--with whom she would form a profound bond that held monumental consequences for them both. A literary alchemist, Patchett plumbs the depths of her experiences to create gold: engaging and moving pieces that are both self-portrait and landscape, each vibrant with emotion and rich in insight. Turning her writer's eye on her own experiences, she transforms the private into the universal, providing us all a way to look at our own worlds anew, and reminds how fleeting and enigmatic life can be. From the enchantments of Kate DiCamillo's children's books (author of the upcoming The Beatryce Prophecy) to youthful memories of Paris; the cherished life gifts given by her three fathers to the unexpected influence of Charles Schultz's Snoopy; the expansive vision of Eudora Welty to the importance of knitting, Patchett connects life and art as she illuminates what matters most. Infused with the author's grace, wit, and warmth, the pieces in These Precious Days resonate deep in the soul, leaving an indelible mark--and demonstrate why Ann Patchett is one of the most celebrated writers of our time."}, {"rank": 7, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1637582358", "primary_isbn13": "9781637582350", "publisher": "Post Hill", "description": "The former White House press secretary gives an account of her journey.", "price": "0.00", "title": "For Such A Time As This", "author": "Kayleigh McEnany", "contributor": "by Kayleigh McEnany", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781637582350.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1637582358?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1637582358", "isbn13": "9781637582350"}, {"isbn10": "1637582366", "isbn13": "9781637582367"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1637582358?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781637582350?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781637582350"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FFOR%2BSUCH%2BA%2BTIME%2BAS%2BTHIS%2FKayleigh%2BMcEnany%2F9781637582350"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781637582350"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781637582350?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/e9d1c746-79a6-5415-b6a8-812150bc9a36", "list_date": "2021/12/26", "published_data": "2021-12-07", "summary": "Kayleigh McEnany describes her path to the White House podium, bringing the reader behind the scenes in the world\u2019s most powerful building and illuminating how faith got her through.

In her brutally honest, hilarious, heartbreaking memoir, she reveals what was going on behind the scenes of her sometimes tumultuous personal and professional life - a story she's never shared, until now. Of the medium she loves, the one that made her a household name, she says, \"Television can put you in a box; the flat-screen can flatten. On TV, you are larger than life but smaller, too. It is not the whole story, and it is not the whole me. This book is.\" Beginning in early childhood, Couric was inspired by her journalist father to pursue the career he loved but couldn't afford to stay in. Balancing her vivacious, outgoing personality with her desire to be taken seriously, she overcame every obstacle in her way: insecurity, an eating disorder, being typecast, sexism...challenges, and how she dealt with them, setting the tone for the rest of her career. Couric talks candidly about adjusting to sudden fame after her astonishing rise to co-anchor of the TODAY show, and guides us through the most momentous events and news stories of the era, to which she had a front-row seat: Rodney King, Anita Hill, Columbine, the death of Princess Diana, 9/11, the Iraq War... In every instance, she relentlessly pursued the facts, ruffling more than a few feathers along the way. She also recalls in vivid and sometimes lurid detail the intense pressure on female anchors to snag the latest \"get\"--often sensational tabloid stories like Jon Benet Ramsey, Tonya Harding, and OJ Simpson. Couric's position as one of the leading lights of her profession was shadowed by the shock and trauma of losing her husband to stage 4 colon cancer when he was just 42, leaving her a widow and single mom to two daughters, 6 and 2. The death of her sister Emily, just three years later, brought yet more trauma--and an unwavering commitment to cancer awareness and research, one of her proudest accomplishments. Couric is unsparing in the details of her historic move to the anchor chair at the CBS Evening News--a world rife with sexism and misogyny. Her \"welcome\" was even more hostile at 60 Minutes, an unrepentant boys club that engaged in outright hazing of even the most established women. In the wake of the MeToo movement, Couric shares her clear-eyed reckoning with gender inequality and predatory behavior in the workplace, and downfall of Matt Lauer--a colleague she had trusted and respected for more than a decade. Couric also talks about the challenge of finding love again, with all the hilarity, false-starts, and drama that search entailed, before finding her midlife Mr. Right. Something she has never discussed publicly--why her second marriage almost didn't happen. Through it all, Couric maintains the wit and sparkle for which she is known and beloved around the world. With her multimedia ventures and her unique, intimate connection with her viewers, she has never stopped working and reinventing herself as TV and media writ large undergo a radical transformation. If you thought you knew Katie Couric, think again. Going There is the fast-paced, emotional, riveting story of a thoroughly modern woman, whose journey took her from humble origins to superstardom. In these pages, you will find a friend, a confidante, a role model, a survivor whose lessons about life will enrich your own."}, {"rank": 7, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1250817862", "primary_isbn13": "9781250817860", "publisher": "Holt", "description": "The model and actress explores the subjects of feminism, sexuality and power.", "price": "0.00", "title": "My Body", "author": "Emily Ratajkowski", "contributor": "by Emily Ratajkowski", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781250817860.jpg", "book_image_width": 324, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250817862?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1250817862", "isbn13": "9781250817860"}, {"isbn10": "1250817870", "isbn13": "9781250817877"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250817862?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781250817860?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781250817860"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FMY%2BBODY%2FEmily%2BRatajkowski%2F9781250817860"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781250817860"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250817860?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/c206c00c-4ad9-5122-a3ef-b6960313e0d9", "list_date": "2021/11/28", "published_data": "2021-11-09", "summary": "In this personal exploration of feminism, sexuality and power, of men's treatment of women and women's rationalizations for accepting that treatment, the acclaimed model and actress presents essays that chronicle moments of her life while investigating culture's fetishization of girls and female beauty."}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 2, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593241312", "primary_isbn13": "9780593241318", "publisher": "Random House", "description": "The founder of the YouTube channel Kurzgesagt gives an overview of elements of the body\u2019s immune system.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Immune", "author": "Philipp Dettmer", "contributor": "by Philipp Dettmer", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593241318.jpg", "book_image_width": 385, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593241312?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593241312", "isbn13": "9780593241318"}, {"isbn10": "0593241339", "isbn13": "9780593241332"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593241312?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593241318?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593241318"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FIMMUNE%2FPhilipp%2BDettmer%2F9780593241318"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593241318"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593241318?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/ff4079a1-eb7e-55ae-a77b-ee87b6263072", "list_date": "2021/11/28", "published_data": "2021-11-02", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 A gorgeously illustrated deep dive into the immune system that will forever change how you think about your body, from the creator of the popular science YouTube channel Kurzgesagt\u2014In a Nutshell \u201cThrough wonderful analogies and a genius for clarifying complex ideas, Immune is a truly brilliant introduction to the human body\u2019s vast system for fighting infections and other threats.\u201d\u2014John Green, #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Fault in Our Stars You wake up and feel a tickle in your throat. Your head hurts. You\u2019re mildly annoyed as you get the kids ready for school and dress for work yourself. Meanwhile, an epic war is being fought, just below your skin. Millions are fighting and dying for you to be able to complain as you head out the door. But most of us never really stop to ask: What even is our immune system? Second only to the human brain in its complexity, it is one of the oldest and most critical facets of life on Earth. Without it, you would die within days. In Immune, Philipp Dettmer, the brains behind the most popular science channel on YouTube, takes readers on a journey through the fortress of the human body and its defenses. There is a constant battle of staggering scale raging within us, full of stories of invasion, strategy, defeat, and noble self-sacrifice. In fact, in the time you\u2019ve been reading this, your immune system has probably identified and eradicated a cancer cell that started to grow in your body. Each chapter delves into an element of the immune system, including defenses like antibodies and inflammation as well as threats like bacteria, allergies, and cancer, as Dettmer reveals why boosting your immune system is actually nonsense, how parasites sneak their way past your body\u2019s defenses, how viruses work, and what goes on in your wounds when you cut yourself. Enlivened by engaging full-color graphics and immersive descriptions, Immune turns one of the most intricate, interconnected, and confusing subjects\u2014immunology\u2014into a gripping adventure through an astonishing alien landscape. Immune is a vital and remarkably fun crash course in what is arguably, and increasingly, the most important system in the body."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1982165197", "primary_isbn13": "9781982165192", "publisher": "Atria", "description": "The six-time N.B.A. champion, two-time Olympic gold medalist and Hall of Famer details his life on and off the court.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Unguarded", "author": "Scottie Pippen with Michael Arkush", "contributor": "by Scottie Pippen with Michael Arkush", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781982165192.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982165197?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1982165197", "isbn13": "9781982165192"}, {"isbn10": "1982165219", "isbn13": "9781982165215"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982165197?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781982165192?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781982165192"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FUNGUARDED%2FScottie%2BPippen%2Bwith%2BMichael%2BArkush%2F9781982165192"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781982165192"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781982165192?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/fad0859a-8e45-5187-a65f-356125d10c2b", "list_date": "2021/11/28", "published_data": "2021-11-09", "summary": "An unflinching memoir from the six-time NBA Champion, two-time Olympic gold medalist, and Hall of Famer\u2014revealing how Scottie Pippen, the youngest of twelve, overcame two family tragedies and universal disregard by college scouts to become an essential component of the greatest basketball dynasty of the last fifty years. Scottie Pippen has been called one of the greatest NBA players for good reason. Simply put, without Pippen, there are no championship banners\u2014let alone six\u2014hanging from the United Center rafters. There\u2019s no Last Dance documentary. There\u2019s no \u201cMichael Jordan\u201d as we know him. The 1990s Chicago Bulls teams would not exist as we know them. So how did the youngest of twelve go from growing up poor in the small town of Hamburg, Arkansas, enduring two family tragedies along the way, to become a revered NBA legend? How did the scrawny teen, overlooked by every major collegiate basketball program, go on to become the fifth overall pick in the 1987 NBA Draft? And, perhaps most compelling, how did Pippen set aside his ego (and his own limitless professional ceiling) in order for the Bulls to become the most dominant basketball dynasty of the last half century? In Unguarded, the six-time champion and two-time Olympic gold medalist finally opens up to offer pointed and transparent takes on Michael Jordan, Phil Jackson, and Dennis Rodman, among others. Pippen details how he cringed at being labeled Jordan\u2019s sidekick, and discusses how he could have (and should have) received more respect from the Bulls\u2019 management and the media. Pippen reveals never-before-told stories about some of the most famous games in league history, including the 1994 playoff game against the New York Knicks when he took himself out with 1.8 seconds to go. He discusses what it was like dealing with Jordan on a day-to-day basis, while serving as the facilitator for the offense and the anchor for the defense. On the 30th anniversary of the Bulls\u2019 first championship, Pippen is finally giving millions of adoring basketball fans what they crave; a raw, unvarnished look into his life, and role within one of the greatest, most popular teams of all time."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 12, "weeks_on_list": 5, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0759554269", "primary_isbn13": "9780759554269", "publisher": "Little, Brown", "description": "A collection of stories from people working in big-city and small-town hospitals.", "price": "0.00", "title": "E.R.

Grant, arguing that the great Civil War commander's battle to save the Union continued to the very end of his presidency when a crisis threatened to fracture the still fragile nation once again. In this follow-up to his acclaimed \"Three Days\" trilogy, Bret Baier's To Rescue the Republic dramatically illuminates the life of one of America's most consequential yet misunderstood leaders, Ulysses S. Grant, whose actions both as general and as president played an unparalleled role in preserving the United States. Born a tanner's son in rugged Ohio in 1822 and battle-tested by the Mexican American War, Grant met his destiny on the bloody fields of the Civil War. His daring and resolve as a general gained the attention of President Lincoln, then desperate for bold leadership. Lincoln appointed Grant as Lieutenant General of the Union Army in March 1864. Within a year, Grant's forces had seized Richmond and forced Robert E. Lee to surrender. Four years later, the reunified nation faced another leadership void after Lincoln's assassination and an unworthy successor completed his term. Again, Grant answered the call. At stake once more was the future of the Union, for though the Southern states had been defeated, it remained to be seen if the former Confederacy could be reintegrated into the country--and if the Union could ensure the rights and welfare of African Americans in the South. Grant met the challenge by boldly advancing an agenda of Reconstruction and aggressively countering the Ku Klux Klan. In his final weeks in the White House, however, Grant faced a crisis that threatened to undo his life's work. The contested presidential election of 1876 produced no clear victory for either Republican Rutherford B. Hayes or Democrat Samuel Tilden, who carried most of the former Confederacy. Soon Southern states vowed to revolt if Tilden was not declared the victor. Grant was determined to use his influence to preserve the Union, establishing an electoral commission to peaceably settle the issue. Grant brokered a grand bargain: the installation of Republican Hayes to the presidency, with concessions to the Democrats that effectively ended Reconstruction. This painful compromise saved the nation, but tragically condemned the South to another century of civil-rights oppression. Deep with contemporary resonance and brimming with fresh detail that takes readers from the battlefields of the Civil War to the corridors of power where men decided the fate of the nation in back rooms, To Rescue the Republic reveals Grant, for all his complexity, to be among the first rank of American heroes."}, {"rank": 6, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0063090023", "primary_isbn13": "9780063090026", "publisher": "Morrow", "description": "An oral history of \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d by two of its stars who host the podcast \u201cTalking Sopranos.\u201d", "price": "0.00", "title": "Woke Up This Morning", "author": "Michael Imperioli and Steve Schirripa with Philip Lerman", "contributor": "by Michael Imperioli and Steve Schirripa with Philip Lerman", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780063090026.jpg", "book_image_width": 334, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063090023?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0063090023", "isbn13": "9780063090026"}, {"isbn10": "0063090031", "isbn13": "9780063090033"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063090023?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780063090026?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780063090026"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FWOKE%2BUP%2BTHIS%2BMORNING%2FMichael%2BImperioli%2Band%2BSteve%2BSchirripa%2Bwith%2BPhilip%2BLerman%2F9780063090026"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780063090026"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780063090026?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/8e905f40-ec40-5eb3-b51e-5154e6113583", "list_date": "2021/11/21", "published_data": "2021-11", "summary": "\"The definitive oral history of the landmark television series and streaming hit The Sopranos, packed with untold stories from behind the scenes and on the set.

The daughter of Indian and Pakistani intellectuals and advocates, Abedin grew up in the United States and Saudi Arabia and traveled widely. Both/And grapples with family, legacy, identity, faith, marriage, motherhood--and work--with wisdom, sophistication, and clarity. Abedin launched full steam into a college internship in the office of the First Lady in 1996, never imagining that her work at the White House would blossom into a career in public service, nor that her career would become an all-consuming way of life. She thrived in rooms with diplomats and sovereigns, entrepreneurs and artists, philanthropists and activists, and witnessed many crucial moments in 21st-century American history--Camp David for urgent efforts at Middle East peace in the waning months of the Clinton administration, Ground Zero in the days after the 9/11 attacks, the inauguration of the first African American president of the United States, the convention floor when America nominated its first female presidential candidate. Abedin's relationship with Hillary Clinton has seen both women through extraordinary personal and professional highs, as well as unimaginable lows. Here, for the first time, is a deeply personal account of Clinton as mentor, confidante, and role model. Abedin cuts through caricature, rumor, and misinformation to reveal a crystal clear portrait of Clinton as a brilliant and caring leader, a steadfast friend, generous, funny, hardworking, and dedicated. Both/And is a candid and heartbreaking chronicle of Abedin's marriage to Anthony Weiner, what drew her to him, how much she wanted to believe in him, the devastation wrought by his betrayals--and their shared love for their son. It is also a timeless story of a young woman with aspirations and ideals coming into her own in high-pressure jobs and a testament to the potential for women in leadership to blaze a path forward while supporting those who follow in their footsteps. Abedin's journey through the opportunities and obstacles, the trials and triumphs, of a full and complex life is a testament to her profound belief that in an increasingly either/or world, she can be both/and. Abedin's compassion and courage, her resilience and grace, her work ethic and mission are an inspiration to people of all ages."}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0062894471", "primary_isbn13": "9780062894472", "publisher": "HarperOne", "description": "Reflections on the identity and purpose of Christianity completed posthumously.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Wholehearted Faith", "author": "Rachel Held Evans with Jeff Chu", "contributor": "by Rachel Held Evans with Jeff Chu", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780062894472.jpg", "book_image_width": 333, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062894471?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0062894471", "isbn13": "9780062894472"}, {"isbn10": "0062894498", "isbn13": "9780062894496"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062894471?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780062894472?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780062894472"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FWHOLEHEARTED%2BFAITH%2FRachel%2BHeld%2BEvans%2Bwith%2BJeff%2BChu%2F9780062894472"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780062894472"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062894472?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/71e4f5ac-5456-5ec9-b5ed-aafbd39189f2", "list_date": "2021/11/21", "published_data": "2021-11-02", "summary": "A new collection of original writings by Rachel Held Evans, whose reflections on faith and life continue to encourage, challenge, and influence. Rachel Held Evans is widely recognized for her theologically astute, profoundly honest, and beautifully personal books, which have guided, instructed, edified, and shaped Christians as they seek to live out a just and loving faith. At the time of her tragic death in 2019, Rachel was working on a new book about wholeheartedness. With the help of her close friend and author Jeff Chu, that work-in-progress has been woven together with some of her other unpublished writings into a rich collection of essays that ask candid questions about the stories we've been told--and the stories we tell--about our faith, our selves, and our world. This book is for the doubter and the dreamer, the seeker and the sojourner, those who long for a sense of spiritual wholeness as well as those who have been hurt by the Church but can't seem to let go of the story of Jesus. Through theological reflection and personal recollection, Rachel wrestles with God's grace and love, looks unsparingly at what the Church is and does, and explores universal human questions about becoming and belonging.

Yet today there is only one\u2014homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us? Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.

Join award-winning filmmaker Ron Howard and audience-favorite actor Clint Howard as they frankly and fondly share their unusual family story of navigating and surviving life as sibling child actors. \"What was it like to grow up on TV?\" Ron Howard has been asked this question throughout his adult life. in The Boys, he and his younger brother, Clint, examine their childhoods in detail for the first time. For Ron, playing Opie on The Andy Griffith Show and Richie Cunningham on Happy Days offered fame, joy, and opportunity--but also invited stress and bullying. For Clint, a fast start on such programs as Gentle Ben and Star Trek petered out in adolescence, with some tough consequences and lessons. With the perspective of time and success--Ron as a filmmaker, producer, and Hollywood A-lister, Clint as a busy character actor--the Howard brothers delve deep into an upbringing that seemed normal to them yet was anything but. Their Midwestern parents, Rance and Jean, moved to California to pursue their own showbiz dreams. But it was their young sons who found steady employment as actors. Rance put aside his ego and ambition to become Ron and Clint's teacher, sage, and moral compass. Jean became their loving protector--sometimes over-protector--from the snares and traps of Hollywood. By turns confessional, nostalgic, heartwarming, and harrowing, THE BOYS is a dual narrative that lifts the lid on the Howard brothers' closely held lives. It's the journey of a tight four-person family unit that held fast in an unforgiving business and of two brothers who survived \"child-actor syndrome\" to become fulfilled adults."}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593423062", "primary_isbn13": "9780593423066", "publisher": "Portfolio", "description": "The linguist gives his assessment of antiracism and offers a plan that he believes will provide justice for Black America.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Woke Racism", "author": "John McWhorter", "contributor": "by John McWhorter", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593423066.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593423062?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593423062", "isbn13": "9780593423066"}, {"isbn10": "0593423070", "isbn13": "9780593423073"}, {"isbn10": "0593509900", "isbn13": "9780593509906"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593423062?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593423066?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593423066"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FWOKE%2BRACISM%2FJohn%2BMcWhorter%2F9780593423066"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593423066"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593423066?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/31a16107-2dd9-534c-92a0-b75e0262f682", "list_date": "2021/11/14", "published_data": "2021-10-26", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER New York Times bestselling author and acclaimed linguist John McWhorter argues that an illiberal neoracism, disguised as antiracism, is hurting Black communities and weakening the American social fabric. Americans of good will on both the left and the right are secretly asking themselves the same question: how has the conversation on race in America gone so crazy? We\u2019re told to read books and listen to music by people of color but that wearing certain clothes is \u201cappropriation.\u201d We hear that being white automatically gives you privilege and that being Black makes you a victim. We want to speak up but fear we\u2019ll be seen as unwoke, or worse, labeled a racist. According to John McWhorter, the problem is that a well-meaning but pernicious form of antiracism has become, not a progressive ideology, but a religion\u2014and one that\u2019s illogical, unreachable, and unintentionally neoracist. In Woke Racism, McWhorter reveals the workings of this new religion, from the original sin of \u201cwhite privilege\u201d and the weaponization of cancel culture to ban heretics, to the evangelical fervor of the \u201cwoke mob.\u201d He shows how this religion that claims to \u201cdismantle racist structures\u201d is actually harming his fellow Black Americans by infantilizing Black people, setting Black students up for failure, and passing policies that disproportionately damage Black communities. The new religion might be called \u201cantiracism,\u201d but it features a racial essentialism that\u2019s barely distinguishable from racist arguments of the past. Fortunately for Black America, and for all of us, it\u2019s not too late to push back against woke racism. McWhorter shares scripts and encouragement with those trying to deprogram friends and family. And most importantly, he offers a roadmap to justice that actually will help, not hurt, Black America."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 5, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "059323152X", "primary_isbn13": "9780593231524", "publisher": "Random House", "description": "The congressman from California describes risks to our democracy and the resurgence of autocracy.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Midnight In Washington", "author": "Adam Schiff", "contributor": "by Adam Schiff", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593231524.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/059323152X?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "059323152X", "isbn13": "9780593231524"}, {"isbn10": "0593231546", "isbn13": "9780593231548"}, {"isbn10": "0593508610", "isbn13": "9780593508619"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/059323152X?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593231524?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593231524"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FMIDNIGHT%2BIN%2BWASHINGTON%2FAdam%2BSchiff%2F9780593231524"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593231524"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593231524?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/470683d3-b599-5c07-9c4c-f551f03818c5", "list_date": "2021/11/14", "published_data": "2021-10-12", "summary": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 The \u201cfascinating\u201d (Rachel Maddow) inside account of American democracy in its darkest hour, from the rise of autocracy unleashed by Trump to the January 6 insurrection, and a warning that those forces remain as potent as ever\u2014from the congressman who led the first impeachment of Donald J. Trump LOS ANGELES TIMES BOOK PRIZE WINNER: \u201cBrilliant, sobering, and unforgettable.\u201d\u2014from the Current Interest Judges\u2019 citation In the years leading up to the election of Donald Trump, Congressman Adam Schiff had already been sounding the alarm over the resurgence of autocracy around the world, and the threat this posed to the United States. But as he led the probe into Donald Trump\u2019s Russia and Ukraine-related abuses of presidential power, Schiff came to the terrible conclusion that the principal threat to American democracy now came from within. In Midnight in Washington, Schiff argues that the Trump presidency has so weakened our institutions and compromised the Republican Party that the peril will last for years, requiring unprecedented vigilance against the growing and dangerous appeal of authoritarianism. The congressman chronicles step-by-step just how our democracy was put at such risk, and traces his own path to meeting the crisis\u2014from serious prosecutor, to congressman with an expertise in national security and a reputation for bipartisanship, to liberal lightning rod, scourge of the right, and archenemy of a president. Schiff takes us inside his team of impeachment managers and their desperate defense of the Constitution amid the rise of a distinctly American brand of autocracy. Deepening our understanding of prominent public moments, Schiff reveals the private struggles, the internal conflicts, and the triumphs of courage that came with defending the republic against a lawless president\u2014but also the slow surrender of people that he had worked with and admired to the dangerous immorality of a president engaged in an historic betrayal of his office. Schiff\u2019s fight for democracy is one of the great dramas of our time, told by the man who became the president\u2019s principal antagonist. It is a story that began with Trump but does not end with him, taking us through the disastrous culmination of the presidency and Schiff\u2019s account of January 6, 2021, and how the antidemocratic forces Trump unleashed continue to define his party, making the future of democracy in America more uncertain than ever."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 12, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1250784093", "primary_isbn13": "9781250784094", "publisher": "Celadon", "description": "The naturalist explores an element of human nature during a time of multiple crises in areas of health, climate and politics.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Book Of Hope", "author": "Jane Goodall and Douglas Abrams with Gail Hudson", "contributor": "by Jane Goodall and Douglas Abrams with Gail Hudson", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781250784094.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250784093?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1250784093", "isbn13": "9781250784094"}, {"isbn10": "1250784085", "isbn13": "9781250784087"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250784093?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781250784094?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781250784094"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BBOOK%2BOF%2BHOPE%2FJane%2BGoodall%2Band%2BDouglas%2BAbrams%2Bwith%2BGail%2BHudson%2F9781250784094"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781250784094"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250784094?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/65ecbd9e-35d7-5232-b8a3-74974d138a57", "list_date": "2021/11/14", "published_data": "2021-10-19", "summary": "Probably the question I am asked more often than any other is: Do you honestly believe there is hope for our world?

Includes a foreword by Barbara Ehrenreich. At 28, Stephanie Land's plans of breaking free from the roots of her hometown in the Pacific Northwest to chase her dreams of attending a university and becoming a writer, were cut short when a summer fling turned into an unexpected pregnancy. She turned to housekeeping to make ends meet, and with a tenacious grip on her dream to provide her daughter the very best life possible, Stephanie worked days and took classes online to earn a college degree, and began to write relentlessly. She wrote the true stories that weren't being told: the stories of overworked and underpaid Americans. Of living on food stamps and WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) coupons to eat. Of the government programs that provided her housing, but that doubled as halfway houses. The aloof government employees who called her lucky for receiving assistance while she didn't feel lucky at all. She wrote to remember the fight, to eventually cut through the deep-rooted stigmas of the working poor. Maid explores the underbelly of upper-middle class America and the reality of what it's like to be in service to them. \"I'd become a nameless ghost,\" Stephanie writes about her relationship with her clients, many of whom do not know her from any other cleaner, but who she learns plenty about. As she begins to discover more about her clients' lives-their sadness and love, too-she begins to find hope in her own path. Her compassionate, unflinching writing as a journalist gives voice to the \"servant\" worker, and those pursuing the American Dream from below the poverty line. Maid is Stephanie's story, but it's not her alone. It is an inspiring testament to the strength, determination, and ultimate triumph of the human spirit."}, {"rank": 9, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1631498231", "primary_isbn13": "9781631498237", "publisher": "Liveright", "description": "The ESPN reporter traces the inner workings of the New England Patriots and their influence on the N.F.L. over two decades.", "price": "0.00", "title": "It'S Better To Be Feared", "author": "Seth Wickersham", "contributor": "by Seth Wickersham", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781631498237.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1631498231?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1631498231", "isbn13": "9781631498237"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1631498231?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781631498237?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781631498237"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FIT%2527S%2BBETTER%2BTO%2BBE%2BFEARED%2FSeth%2BWickersham%2F9781631498237"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781631498237"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781631498237?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/608a1b06-ea37-57d4-a11b-c053f21118d1", "list_date": "2021/10/31", "published_data": "2021-10-12", "summary": "Over two unbelievable decades, the New England Patriots were not only the NFL\u2019s most dominant team, but also\u2014and by far\u2014the most secretive. How did they achieve and sustain greatness\u2014and what were the costs? In It\u2019s Better to Be Feared, Seth Wickersham, one of the nation\u2019s finest investigative sportswriters, presents the definitive account of the New England Patriots dynasty, capturing the brilliance, ambition, and ruthlessness that powered it. Having covered the team since Tom Brady took over as starting quarterback in 2001, Wickersham draws on an immense range of sources, including previously confidential game plans, scouting reports, and internal studies as well as hundreds of interviews gathered over two decades\u2014with Brady, Bill Belichick, and other players, coaches, and front office personnel\u2014to offer a behind-the-scenes chronicle of the dynasty\u2019s three acts: the initial burst of Super Bowls from 2001 to 2005; the plateau period, 2006 to 2014, stalked by scandal, injury, and near-misses; and the second three Super Bowl victories between 2015 and 2019, which allowed the Patriots to make their claim upon history. At every step, Wickersham demonstrates just how Belichick and Brady shaped the Patriots and reshaped the entire NFL. We are taken deep into Belichick\u2019s tactical mind, odd work habits, and strained relationships, including his sincere but unspoken love for the players and a near fistfight with a former assistant coach. It is an illuminating depiction of a mastermind, and an organization, dedicated not only to winning but to breaking a league designed to prevent the emergence of a single, unbeatable team. Yet it is in Wickersham\u2019s portrait of Brady\u2014from his childhood in northern California to his challenging years at the University of Michigan to his astonishing early superstardom in the NFL\u2014that the source of the Patriots\u2019 sheer endurance comes into focus. Even as he navigated an improbable rise to fame, Brady was driven by a totalizing ambition to be great, not as an endpoint, but as an ever-unfolding process. Sustaining greatness, however, came with a price. Wickersham reveals, to an extent no other journalist has, the clashes among the coach, the quarterback, and the owner, Robert Kraft\u2014conflicts that resulted in the team\u2019s best performances but also, eventually, the dissolution of the dynasty itself. Raucous, unvarnished, and propulsive, It\u2019s Better to Be Feared is an instant classic of American sportswriting, and an unforgettable study of what it takes to reach, and remain at, the summit of human achievement."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 8, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0358574315", "primary_isbn13": "9780358574316", "publisher": "Mariner", "description": "The foreign policy expert traces her life from being a coal miner\u2019s daughter in northern England to her testimony in the first impeachment inquiry of former President Trump.", "price": "0.00", "title": "There Is Nothing For You Here", "author": "Fiona Hill", "contributor": "by Fiona Hill", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780358574316.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0358574315?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0358574315", "isbn13": "9780358574316"}, {"isbn10": "0358574242", "isbn13": "9780358574248"}, {"isbn10": "0358578906", "isbn13": "9780358578901"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0358574315?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780358574316?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780358574316"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHERE%2BIS%2BNOTHING%2BFOR%2BYOU%2BHERE%2FFiona%2BHill%2F9780358574316"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780358574316"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780358574316?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/85e31d6e-a335-52eb-88fe-b09d6ec2da57", "list_date": "2021/10/31", "published_data": "2021-09-07", "summary": "A celebrated foreign policy expert and key impeachment witness reveals how declining opportunity has set America on the grim path of modern Russia--and draws on her personal journey out of poverty, and her unique perspectives as an historian and policy maker, to show how we can return hope to our forgotten places."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1101984694", "primary_isbn13": "9781101984697", "publisher": "Dutton", "description": "The actor and humorist shares stories and observations from three quests taken in the outdoors.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Where The Deer And The Antelope Play", "author": "Nick Offerman", "contributor": "by Nick Offerman", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781101984697.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1101984694?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1101984694", "isbn13": "9781101984697"}, {"isbn10": "1101984716", "isbn13": "9781101984710"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1101984694?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781101984697?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781101984697"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FWHERE%2BTHE%2BDEER%2BAND%2BTHE%2BANTELOPE%2BPLAY%2FNick%2BOfferman%2F9781101984697"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781101984697"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781101984697?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/41296d86-031a-5fb6-bfeb-9ceccd5a287e", "list_date": "2021/10/31", "published_data": "2021-10-12", "summary": "A humorous and rousing set of literal and figurative sojourns as well as a mission statement about comprehending, protecting, and truly experiencing the outdoors, fueled by three journeys undertaken by actor, humorist, and New York Times bestselling author Nick Offerman Nick Offerman has always felt a particular affection for the Land of the Free\u2014not just for the people and their purported ideals but to the actual land itself: the bedrock, the topsoil, and everything in between that generates the health of your local watershed. In his new book, Nick takes a humorous, inspiring, and elucidating trip to America's trails, farms, and frontier to examine the people who inhabit the land, what that has meant to them and us, and to the land itself, both historically and currently. In 2018, Wendell Berry posed a question to Nick, a query that planted the seed of this book, sending Nick on two memorable journeys with pals\u2014a hiking trip to Glacier National Park with his friends Jeff Tweedy and George Saunders, as well as an extended visit to his friend James Rebanks, the author of The Shepherd's Life and English Pastoral.

These three quests inspired some \u201cdeep-ish\" thinking from Nick, about the history and philosophy of our relationship with nature in our national parks, in our farming, and in our backyards; what we mean when we talk about conservation; and the importance of outdoor recreation, all subjects very close to Nick's heart.

The concept of the \"citizen,\" an idea we take for granted, is historically quite rare--and was, until recently, amongst America's most profoundly cherished ideals. But without shock treatment, warns historian and conservative political commentator Victor Davis Hanson, American citizenship as we have known it for well over two centuries may soon vanish. In The Dying Citizen, Hanson outlines the forces that have brought us to the twilight of American citizenship, and led to the deeply fractured politics of the present era. Over the last half-century, numerous forces from both above and below have conspired to undermine the value we place in the idea of citizenship--and our vigilance in protecting it. To be self-governing, citizens must be economically autonomous, but the evisceration of the middle class and the rise of inequality have made many Americans dependent on the federal government. Citizenship exists within delineated borders--but open borders and the elite concept of \"global citizenship\" have rendered meaningless the idea of allegiance to a particular place. Citizenship relies on the renunciation of tribal identity in favor of the state, but identity politics have eradicated the idea of a collective civic sense of self. A vastly expanded unelected bureaucracy has overwhelmed the power of elected officials, thereby destroying the sovereign power of the citizen. Progressive academics and activists lay siege to the institutions and traditions of constitutional citizenship. As in the revolutionary years of 1848, 1917, and 1968, 2020 has ripped away our complacency about the future of our most cherished ideals. Americans are forced to confront the fragility of citizenship--indeed, the fragility of our nation. But this calamitous year may also teach Americans to rebuild and recover what we have lost. The choice is ours."}, {"rank": 9, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0316558796", "primary_isbn13": "9780316558792", "publisher": "Little, Brown", "description": "Public and private moments chronicled from the humorist\u2019s 2003-20 diaries.", "price": "0.00", "title": "A Carnival Of Snackery", "author": "David Sedaris", "contributor": "by David Sedaris", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780316558792.jpg", "book_image_width": 323, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316558796?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0316558796", "isbn13": "9780316558792"}, {"isbn10": "0316256463", "isbn13": "9780316256469"}, {"isbn10": "1549108212", "isbn13": "9781549108211"}, {"isbn10": "1549108468", "isbn13": "9781549108464"}, {"isbn10": "0316270180", "isbn13": "9780316270182"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316558796?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780316558792?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780316558792"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FA%2BCARNIVAL%2BOF%2BSNACKERY%2FDavid%2BSedaris%2F9780316558792"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780316558792"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780316558792?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/f6f51789-e634-5f3c-9bd9-3473eeb37245", "list_date": "2021/10/24", "published_data": "2021-10-05", "summary": "Picking up where his previous volume of diaries, Theft by Finding, left off, David Sedaris chronicles the years 2003-2020."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 27, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0804190119", "primary_isbn13": "9780804190114", "publisher": "Tim Duggan", "description": "Twenty lessons from the 20th century about the course of tyranny.", "price": "0.00", "title": "On Tyranny", "author": "Timothy Snyder", "contributor": "by Timothy Snyder", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780804190114.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 465, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Tyranny-Twenty-Lessons-Twentieth-Century/dp/0804190119?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0804190119", "isbn13": "9780804190114"}, {"isbn10": "0804190127", "isbn13": "9780804190121"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Tyranny-Twenty-Lessons-Twentieth-Century/dp/0804190119?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780804190114?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780804190114"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FON%2BTYRANNY%2FTimothy%2BSnyder%2F9780804190114"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780804190114"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780804190114?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/eeb07cb6-f672-5b8d-b85d-6ce6f62b1856", "list_date": "2021/10/24", "published_data": "2017-02-28", "summary": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 A \u201cbracing\u201d (Vox) guide for surviving and resisting America\u2019s turn towards authoritarianism, from \u201ca rising public intellectual unafraid to make bold connections between past and present\u201d (The New York Times) \u201cTimothy Snyder reasons with unparalleled clarity, throwing the past and future into sharp relief.

A Confederacy of Dumptys takes us through a history of twenty-five \"American Scoundrels\" in this all-new collection of Lithgow's satirical poems and illustrations. While the Trump Era was rife with corruption and abuse of power, it was nothing new. Through Lithgow's cutting humor, you will read about a rogues' gallery of villains that came before Donald J. Trump, powerful men and women who were corrupt, venal, criminal, adulterous, racist, or just plain disgusting. With dark and lyrical stories from across American history, you will learn about long-forgotten figures and bad actors of today, including the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, the perpetrator of 19th century women's pyramid schemes, and participants in both the Watergate scandal and the Capitol insurrection. Trump and Nixon show up, of course, but also Leona Helmsley, Boss Tweed, Typhoid Mary, Newt Gingrich, Ted Cruz, and many more. Skipping through time, and delivered with classic Lithgow wit and style, A Confederacy of Dumptys is an exuberant reminder of how not to repeat history. Digital audio edition read by the author.

His impact was outsized and his legacy has only grown since his death. Now, for the first time, we have been granted a look into Bourdain's life through the stories and recollections of his closest friends and colleagues. Laurie Woolever, Bourdain's longtime assistant and confidante, interviewed nearly a hundred of the people who shared Tony's orbit--from members of his kitchen crews to his writing, publishing, and television partners, to his daughter and his closest friends--in order to piece together a remarkably full, vivid, and nuanced vision of Tony's life and work. From his childhood and teenage days, to his early years in New York, through the genesis of his game-changing memoir Kitchen Confidential to his emergence as a writing and television personality, and in the words of friends and colleagues including Eric Ripert, Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, Nigella Lawson, and W. Kamau Bell, as well as family members including his brother and his late mother, we see the many sides of Tony--his motivations, his ambivalence, his vulnerability, his blind spots, and his brilliance.

This story. The first true heartbeat of UNREQUITED INFATUATIONSis the moment when Stevie Van Zandt trades in his devotion to the Baptist religion for an obsession with Rock and Roll. Groups like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones created new ideas of community, creative risk, and principled rebellion. They changed him forever. While still a teenager, he met Bruce Springsteen, a like-minded outcast/true believer who became one of his most important friends and bandmates. As Miami Steve, Van Zandt anchored the E Street Band as they conquered the Rock and Roll world. And then, in the early '80s, Van Zandt stepped away from E Street to embark on his own odyssey. He refashioned himself as Little Steven, a political songwriter and performer, fell in love with Maureen Santoro who greatly expanded his artistic palette, and visited the world's hot spots as an artist/journalist to not just better understand them, but to help change them. Most famously, he masterminded the recording of \"Sun City,\" an anti-apartheid anthem that sped the demise of South Africa's institutionalized racism and helped get Nelson Mandela out of prison. By the '90s, Van Zandt had lived at least two lives--one as a mainstream rocker, one as a hardcore activist. It was time for a third. David Chase invited Van Zandt to be a part of his new television show, the Sopranos--as Silvio Dante, he was the unconditionally loyal consiglieri who sat at the right hand of Tony Soprano (a relationship that oddly mirrored his real-life relationship with Bruce Springsteen). Underlying all of Van Zandt's various incarnations was a devotion to preserving the centrality of the arts, especially the endangered species of Rock. In the twenty-first century, Van Zandt founded a groundbreaking radio show (Underground Garage), a fiercely independent record label (Wicked Cool), and developed a curriculum to teach students of all ages through the medium of music history. He also rejoined the E Street Band for what has now been a twenty-year victory lap. UNREQUITED INFATUATIONS chronicles the twists and turns of Stevie Van Zandt's always surprising life. It is more than just the testimony of a globe-trotting nomad, more than the story of a groundbreaking activist, more than the odyssey of a spiritual seeker, and more than a master class in rock and roll (not to mention a dozen other crafts). It's the best book of its kind because it's the only book of its kind."}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1982180587", "primary_isbn13": "9781982180584", "publisher": "Avid Reader", "description": "The accomplishments of some of the sport\u2019s greatest players past and present are put into context with one another", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Baseball 100", "author": "Joe Posnanski", "contributor": "by Joe Posnanski", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781982180584.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982180587?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1982180587", "isbn13": "9781982180584"}, {"isbn10": "1982180609", "isbn13": "9781982180607"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982180587?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781982180584?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781982180584"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BBASEBALL%2B100%2FJoe%2BPosnanski%2F9781982180584"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781982180584"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781982180584?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/c01ba7e2-077b-5185-b7c5-6dbd651cb112", "list_date": "2021/10/17", "published_data": "2021-09-28", "summary": "A sportswriter and lifelong student of the game, Posnanski that tells the story of baseball through the lives of its greatest players.

Can it help us understand why there is so much irrationality in the world? Steven Pinker, author of Enlightenment Now (Bill Gates\u2019s \"new favorite book of all time\u201d) answers all the questions here Today humanity is reaching new heights of scientific understanding--and also appears to be losing its mind. How can a species that developed vaccines for Covid-19 in less than a year produce so much fake news, medical quackery, and conspiracy theorizing? Pinker rejects the cynical clich\u00e9 that humans are simply irrational--cavemen out of time saddled with biases, fallacies, and illusions. After all, we discovered the laws of nature, lengthened and enriched our lives, and set out the benchmarks for rationality itself. We actually think in ways that are sensible in the low-tech contexts in which we spend most of our lives, but fail to take advantage of the powerful tools of reasoning we\u2019ve discovered over the millennia: logic, critical thinking, probability, correlation and causation, and optimal ways to update beliefs and commit to choices individually and with others. These tools are not a standard part of our education, and have never been presented clearly and entertainingly in a single book--until now. Rationality also explores its opposite: how the rational pursuit of self-interest, sectarian solidarity, and uplifting mythology can add up to crippling irrationality in a society. Collective rationality depends on norms that are explicitly designed to promote objectivity and truth. Rationality matters. It leads to better choices in our lives and in the public sphere, and is the ultimate driver of social justice and moral progress.

Eight months after Germany's invasion of Poland, the Nazis roll into The Netherlands, expanding their reign of brutality to the Dutch. But by the Winter of 1943, resistance is growing. Among those fighting their brutal Nazi occupiers are two Jewish sisters, Janny and Lien Brilleslijper from Amsterdam. Risking arrest and death, the sisters help save others, sheltering them in a clandestine safehouse in the woods, they called \"The High Nest.\" This secret refuge would become one of the most important Jewish safehouses in the country, serving as a hiding place and underground center for resistance partisans as well as artists condemned by Hitler. From The High Nest, an underground web of artists arises, giving hope and light to those living in terror in Holland as they begin to restore the dazzling pre-war life of Amsterdam and The Hague. When the house and its occupants are eventually betrayed, the most terrifying time of the sisters' lives begins. As Allied troops close in, the Brilleslijper family are rushed onto the last train to Auschwitz, along with Anne Frank and her family. The journey will bring Janny and Lien close to Anne and her older sister Margot. The days ahead will test the sisters beyond human imagination as they are stripped of everything but their courage, their resilience, and their love for each other. Based on meticulous research and unprecedented access to the Brilleslijpers' personal archives of memoirs and photos, Sisters of Auschwitz is a long-overdue homage to two young women's heroism and moral bravery--and a reminder of the power each of us has to change the world."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593086880", "primary_isbn13": "9780593086889", "publisher": "Portfolio", "description": "The evolutionary biologists posit that the modern world is out of sync with our ancient brains and bodies.", "price": "0.00", "title": "A Hunter-Gatherer'S Guide To The 21St Century", "author": "Heather Heying and Bret Weinstein", "contributor": "by Heather Heying and Bret Weinstein", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593086889.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593086880?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593086880", "isbn13": "9780593086889"}, {"isbn10": "0593086899", "isbn13": "9780593086896"}, {"isbn10": "059345765X", "isbn13": "9780593457658"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593086880?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593086889?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593086889"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FA%2BHUNTER-GATHERER%2527S%2BGUIDE%2BTO%2BTHE%2B21ST%2BCENTURY%2FHeather%2BHeying%2Band%2BBret%2BWeinstein%2F9780593086889"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593086889"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593086889?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/6cd3baac-16a5-5f40-813b-6bd569572630", "list_date": "2021/10/17", "published_data": "2021-09-14", "summary": "A provocative exploration of the tension between our evolutionary history and our modern woes\u2014and what we can do about it.

How do we explain the gap between these truths? And how should we respond? For evolutionary biologists Heather Heying and Bret Weinstein, the cause of our troubles is clear: the accelerat\u00ading rate of change in the modern world has outstripped the capacity of our brains and bodies to adapt.

In the early 2000s, Scott Gottlieb spent years at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration developing a \"Pandemic Influenza Plan\" to ready the United States for the threat of a global pandemic. Besides developing a response playbook, the Bush Administration also drilled for the event. But when he returned to Washington as FDA director in 2017, Gottlieb discovered that the agency had been using the same outdated plan and obsolete tools to face Ebola, Zika, and swine flu. Shortly after his departure in late 2019, Covid-19 hit the United States. Members of the Trump administration were slow to mount an effective response. Nine months later, the federal government's response remains woefully inadequate and the Trump administration continues to focus on the wrong things. Schools should be opening safely and the government should be building the infrastructure for hundreds of millions of vaccines. Instead, the administration is cutting funding, has amassed warehouses full of hydroxychloroquine, and speak as if the virus has disappeared, even as infections--and deaths--continue to rise. In Preparing for the Inevitable, Gottlieb identifies the reasons why the U.S. was so underprepared for the pandemic, from failing to enlist the private sector in large-scale manufacturing of testing supplies and medical equipment to resolutely sticking to the narrative that Covid would go away on its own. He warns that if we don't correct these failures, the virus will continue to flourish, more people will get sick and die, and may impact the distribution of a vaccine when one is available. Hard-hitting and informed by Gottlieb's experience both in government and medicine, Preparing for the Inevitable is the essential inside account of one of the most tragic--and preventable--failures in American history."}, {"rank": 7, "rank_last_week": 7, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0062979930", "primary_isbn13": "9780062979933", "publisher": "Dey Street", "description": "The actress shares some of the challenges and changes she has faced in recent years.", "price": "0.00", "title": "You Got Anything Stronger?", "author": "Gabrielle Union with Kevin Carr O\u2019Leary", "contributor": "by Gabrielle Union with Kevin Carr O\u2019Leary", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780062979933.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062979930?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0062979930", "isbn13": "9780062979933"}, {"isbn10": "0062979957", "isbn13": "9780062979957"}, {"isbn10": "0063119714", "isbn13": "9780063119710"}, {"isbn10": "0062979965", "isbn13": "9780062979964"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062979930?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780062979933?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780062979933"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FYOU%2BGOT%2BANYTHING%2BSTRONGER%253F%2FGabrielle%2BUnion%2Bwith%2BKevin%2BCarr%2BO%25E2%2580%2599Leary%2F9780062979933"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780062979933"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062979933?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/5c9b48b5-d2bb-5896-a4a3-6d84b69a6604", "list_date": "2021/10/10", "published_data": "2021", "summary": "\"Activist, actress, and ... author Gabrielle Union is back with an even more intimate, revealing, and powerful collection of essays\"--"}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 2, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1982176520", "primary_isbn13": "9781982176525", "publisher": "Avid Reader", "description": "The intelligence gathering, security strategizing and military planning during the final eight months of the pursuit of Osama bin Laden.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Countdown Bin Laden", "author": "Chris Wallace with Mitch Weiss", "contributor": "by Chris Wallace with Mitch Weiss", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781982176525.jpg", "book_image_width": 327, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982176520?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1982176520", "isbn13": "9781982176525"}, {"isbn10": "1982176547", "isbn13": "9781982176549"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982176520?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781982176525?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781982176525"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FCOUNTDOWN%2BBIN%2BLADEN%2FChris%2BWallace%2Bwith%2BMitch%2BWeiss%2F9781982176525"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781982176525"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781982176525?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/12155a95-5bf7-5f81-8f07-de74fd12075e", "list_date": "2021/10/10", "published_data": "2021-09-07", "summary": "Following Chris Wallace\u2019s \u201criveting\u201d (The New York Times) and \u201cpropulsive\u201d (Time) #1 national bestseller Countdown 1945 comes a deeply reported, revelatory, and thrillingly told account of the final months of the hunt for Osama bin Laden. On August 27, 2010, three CIA officers ask for a private meeting with CIA Director Leon Panetta. During that secret session, they tell Panetta that agents have tracked a courier with deep Al Qaeda ties to a three-story house at the end of a dead-end street in Abbottabad, Pakistan. But they say it\u2019s more than a house\u2014it\u2019s a heavily protected fortress. No one in the meeting says the name bin Laden. They don\u2019t have to. Everyone understands that finally, after nearly a decade, maybe, just maybe, they\u2019ve found the world\u2019s most wanted man. In Countdown bin Laden, celebrated journalist and anchor of Fox News Sunday Chris Wallace delivers a thrilling new account of the final eight months of intelligence gathering, national security strategizing, and meticulous military planning that leads to the climactic mission when SEAL Team Six closes in on its target. The book delivers new information collected from Wallace\u2019s in-depth interviews with more than a dozen central figures, including Admiral William H. McRaven\u2014leader of the operation in Pakistan\u2014as well as CIA Director Panetta, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, National Security Advisor Tom Donilon, and two members of SEAL Team Six who participate in the raid, including the special operator who kills Osama bin Laden. Wallace also brings to life the human elements of this story, talking to families who lost loved ones on 9/11, sharing what relatives of SEAL Team Six went through, and bringing us inside the tense Situation Room during the raid. Published on the twentieth anniversary of 9/11, Countdown bin Laden is a historical thriller filled with intrigue, cinematic action, and fresh reporting about the race to apprehend and bring to justice the mastermind of the most consequential terrorist attack in American history."}, {"rank": 9, "rank_last_week": 4, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1324001933", "primary_isbn13": "9781324001935", "publisher": "Norton", "description": "An exploration of disciplinary actions and preventative measures occuring at the intersection of human behavior and wildlife biology.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Fuzz", "author": "Mary Roach", "contributor": "by Mary Roach", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781324001935.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1324001933?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1324001933", "isbn13": "9781324001935"}, {"isbn10": "1324001844", "isbn13": "9781324001843"}, {"isbn10": "1324036125", "isbn13": "9781324036128"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1324001933?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781324001935?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781324001935"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FFUZZ%2FMary%2BRoach%2F9781324001935"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781324001935"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781324001935?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/8eef03c4-9cae-56a8-96a0-fc0543f41df8", "list_date": "2021/10/10", "published_data": "2021-09-14", "summary": "What\u2019s to be done about a jaywalking moose? A bear caught breaking and entering? A murderous tree? Three hundred years ago, animals that broke the law would be assigned legal representation and put on trial. These days, as New York Times best-selling author Mary Roach discovers, the answers are best found not in jurisprudence but in science: the curious science of human-wildlife conflict, a discipline at the crossroads of human behavior and wildlife biology. Roach tags along with animal-attack forensics investigators, human-elephant conflict specialists, bear managers, and \"danger tree\" faller blasters. Intrepid as ever, she travels from leopard-terrorized hamlets in the Indian Himalaya to St. Peter\u2019s Square in the early hours before the pope arrives for Easter Mass, when vandal gulls swoop in to destroy the elaborate floral display. She taste-tests rat bait, learns how to install a vulture effigy, and gets mugged by a macaque. Combining little-known forensic science and conservation genetics with a motley cast of laser scarecrows, langur impersonators, and trespassing squirrels, Roach reveals as much about humanity as about nature\u2019s lawbreakers. When it comes to \"problem\" wildlife, she finds, humans are more often the problem\u2014and the solution. Fascinating, witty, and humane, Fuzz offers hope for compassionate coexistence in our ever-expanding human habitat."}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0525658815", "primary_isbn13": "9780525658818", "publisher": "Knopf", "description": "The Pulitzer Prize-winning author recounts the impact an ill-behaved stray dog had on him during an uncertain time.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Speckled Beauty", "author": "Rick Bragg", "contributor": "by Rick Bragg", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780525658818.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525658815?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0525658815", "isbn13": "9780525658818"}, {"isbn10": "0525658823", "isbn13": "9780525658825"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525658815?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780525658818?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780525658818"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BSPECKLED%2BBEAUTY%2FRick%2BBragg%2F9780525658818"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780525658818"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780525658818?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/26d8b2b2-dffe-562f-b1f9-8a465cad32ee", "list_date": "2021/10/10", "published_data": "2021-09-21", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLER \u2022 From the best-selling, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of All Over but the Shoutin', the warmhearted and hilarious story of how his life was transformed by his love for a poorly behaved, half-blind stray dog.

He is a terrible boy, a defiant, self-destructive, often malodorous boy, a grave robber and screen door moocher who spends his days playing chicken with the Fed Ex man, picking fights with thousand-pound livestock, and rolling in donkey manure, and his nights howling at the moon. He has been that way since the moment he appeared on the ridgeline behind Rick Bragg's house, a starved and half-dead creature, seventy-six pounds of wet hair and poor decisions. Speck arrived in Rick's life at a moment of looming uncertainty. A cancer diagnosis, chemo, kidney failure, and recurring pneumonia had left Rick lethargic and melancholy.

achievement.\u201d \u2014The Boston Globe Does George Washington still matter? Bestselling author Nathaniel Philbrick argues for Washington\u2019s unique contribution to the forging of America by retracing his journey as a new president through all thirteen former colonies, which were now an unsure nation. Travels with George marks a new first-person voice for Philbrick, weaving history and personal reflection into a single narrative. When George Washington became president in 1789, the United States of America was still a loose and quarrelsome confederation and a tentative political experiment. Washington undertook a tour of the ex-colonies to talk to ordinary citizens about his new government, and to imbue in them the idea of being one thing\u2014Americans. In the fall of 2018, Nathaniel Philbrick embarked on his own journey into what Washington called \u201cthe infant woody country\u201d to see for himself what America had become in the 229 years since. Writing in a thoughtful first person about his own adventures with his wife, Melissa, and their dog, Dora, Philbrick follows Washington\u2019s presidential excursions: from Mount Vernon to the new capital in New York; a monthlong tour of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island; a venture onto Long Island and eventually across Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. The narrative moves smoothly between the eighteenth and twenty-first centuries as we see the country through both Washington\u2019s and Philbrick\u2019s eyes. Written at a moment when America\u2019s founding figures are under increasing scrutiny, Travels with George grapples bluntly and honestly with Washington\u2019s legacy as a man of the people, a reluctant president, and a plantation owner who held people in slavery. At historic houses and landmarks, Philbrick reports on the reinterpretations at work as he meets reenactors, tour guides, and other keepers of history\u2019s flame. He paints a picture of eighteenth-century America as divided and fraught as it is today, and he comes to understand how Washington compelled, enticed, stood up to, and listened to the many different people he met along the way\u2014and how his all-consuming belief in the union helped to forge a nation."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 4, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0385547218", "primary_isbn13": "9780385547215", "publisher": "Doubleday", "description": "A 7-year-old girl and her parents encounter difficulties in New York City when they leave China in the 1990s.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Beautiful Country", "author": "Qian Julie Wang", "contributor": "by Qian Julie Wang", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780385547215.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385547218?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0385547218", "isbn13": "9780385547215"}, {"isbn10": "0385547242", "isbn13": "9780385547246"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385547218?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780385547215?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780385547215"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FBEAUTIFUL%2BCOUNTRY%2FQian%2BJulie%2BWang%2F9780385547215"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780385547215"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780385547215?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/0b279148-fe4f-5b50-904f-d945008d4d8c", "list_date": "2021/10/03", "published_data": "2021-09-07", "summary": "A NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLER \u2022 The moving story of an undocumented child living in poverty in the richest country in the world\u2014an incandescent debut from an astonishing new talent \u2022 A TODAY SHOW #READWITHJENNA PICK In Chinese, the word for America, Mei Guo, translates directly to \u201cbeautiful country.\u201d Yet when seven-year-old Qian arrives in New York City in 1994 full of curiosity, she is overwhelmed by crushing fear and scarcity. In China, Qian\u2019s parents were professors; in America, her family is \u201cillegal\u201d and it will require all the determination and small joys they can muster to survive. In Chinatown, Qian\u2019s parents labor in sweatshops. Instead of laughing at her jokes, they fight constantly, taking out the stress of their new life on one another. Shunned by her classmates and teachers for her limited English, Qian takes refuge in the library and masters the language through books, coming to think of The Berenstain Bears as her first American friends. And where there is delight to be found, Qian relishes it: her first bite of gloriously greasy pizza, weekly \u201cshopping days,\u201d when Qian finds small treasures in the trash lining Brooklyn\u2019s streets, and a magical Christmas visit to Rockefeller Center\u2014confirmation that the New York City she saw in movies does exist after all.

As Ba Ba retreats further inward, Qian has little to hold onto beyond his constant refrain: Whatever happens, say that you were born here, that you\u2019ve always lived here. Inhabiting her childhood perspective with exquisite lyric clarity and unforgettable charm and strength, Qian Julie Wang has penned an essential American story about a family fracturing under the weight of invisibility, and a girl coming of age in the shadows, who never stops seeking the light."}, {"rank": 5, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1982158247", "primary_isbn13": "9781982158248", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "description": "The hip-hop recording artist known as Logic tells his life story.", "price": "0.00", "title": "This Bright Future", "author": "Bob Hall", "contributor": "by Bobby Hall", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781982158248.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982158247?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1982158247", "isbn13": "9781982158248"}, {"isbn10": "1982158263", "isbn13": "9781982158262"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982158247?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781982158248?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781982158248"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHIS%2BBRIGHT%2BFUTURE%2FBob%2BHall%2F9781982158248"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781982158248"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781982158248?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/8975406c-a407-5ea8-8b1f-33c2c234a2e5", "list_date": "2021/09/26", "published_data": "2021-09-07", "summary": "An explosive memoir from Bobby Hall, the multiplatinum recording artist known as Logic, who emerged from the wreckage of a horrifically abusive childhood to become an era-defining artist of our tumultuous age"}, {"rank": 7, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1538704196", "primary_isbn13": "9781538704196", "publisher": "Grand Central", "description": "The Disney child star of the 1960s and daughter of an acclaimed British actor shares some of her experiences in Hollywood.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Forever Young", "author": "Hayley Mills", "contributor": "by Hayley Mills", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781538704196.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1538704196?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1538704196", "isbn13": "9781538704196"}, {"isbn10": "1538704188", "isbn13": "9781538704189"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1538704196?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781538704196?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781538704196"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FFOREVER%2BYOUNG%2FHayley%2BMills%2F9781538704196"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781538704196"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781538704196?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/032acda9-2712-5791-a35f-67f3c60e4f50", "list_date": "2021/09/26", "published_data": "2021-09-07", "summary": "Iconic actress Hayley Mills shares personal memories from her storied childhood, growing up in a famous acting family and becoming a Disney child star, trying to grow up in a world that wanted her to stay forever young. The daughter of acclaimed British actor Sir John Mills was still a preteen when she began her acting career and was quickly thrust into the spotlight. Under the wing of Walt Disney himself, Hayley Mills was transformed into one of the biggest child starlets of the 1960s through her iconic roles in Pollyanna, The Parent Trap, and many more. She became one of only twelve actors in history to be bestowed with the Academy Juvenile Award, presented at the Oscars by its first recipient, Shirley Temple, and went on to win a number of awards including a Golden Globe, multiple BAFTAs, and a Disney Legacy Award. Now, in her charming and forthright memoir, she provides a unique window into when Hollywood was still 'Tinseltown' and the great Walt Disney was at his zenith, ruling over what was (at least in his own head) still a family business. This behind-the-scenes look at the drama of having a sky-rocketing career as a young teen in an esteemed acting family will offer both her childhood impressions of the wild and glamorous world she was swept into, and the wisdom and broader knowledge that time has given her. Hayley will delve intimately into her relationship with Walt Disney, as well as the emotional challenges of being bound to a wholesome, youthful public image as she grew into her later teen years, and how that impacted her and her choices--including marrying a producer over 30 years her senior when she was 20! With her regrets, her joys, her difficulties, and her triumphs, this is a compelling read for any fan of classic Disney films and an inside look at a piece of real Hollywood history."}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 1, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1982159006", "primary_isbn13": "9781982159009", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "description": "An investigative reporter for The Washington Post gives an account of how three successive presidents and their military commanders handled America\u2019s invasion of Afghanistan after 9/11.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Afghanistan Papers", "author": "Craig Whitlock", "contributor": "by Craig Whitlock", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781982159009.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982159006?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1982159006", "isbn13": "9781982159009"}, {"isbn10": "1982159022", "isbn13": "9781982159023"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982159006?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781982159009?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781982159009"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BAFGHANISTAN%2BPAPERS%2FCraig%2BWhitlock%2F9781982159009"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781982159009"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781982159009?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/a538a93a-d37a-5a67-a330-9056af0f8c15", "list_date": "2021/09/26", "published_data": "2021-08-31", "summary": "\"The groundbreaking investigative story of how three successive presidents and their military commanders deceived the public year after year about the longest war in American history\"--"}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1982165731", "primary_isbn13": "9781982165734", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "description": "Conversations that explore what America is and what it could be with leaders in various fields.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The American Experiment", "author": "David M.

Few in history can match the breadth and depth of the revolutionary career of the Marquis de Lafayette. Over fifty incredible years at the heart of the Age of Revolution, he fought as one with righteous revolutionaries on both sides of the Atlantic. As an idealistic and courageous teenager serving in the American Revolution, he used his considerable wealth and savvy to help the Americans defeat the British. Then he returned home, and was a principle player in the French Revolution. And in his final act, at seventy years old, he was instrumental in the dramatic overthrow of the Bourbon Dynasty during the Revolution of 1830. All the while, he never wavered from the principles he had written into the Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789: That men are born and remain free and equal, deserving of liberty, property, safety, freedom of speech, and the ability to resist oppression. Through this age of upheaval, Lafayette remained unshakably committed to the principles he had outlined. From the time that he was an enthusiastic 19-year-old to the time he was a world-weary 74-year-old, his resolve never wavered. As the saying goes, if we don't learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it. Today, the values codified and practiced by Lafayette are increasingly taken for granted. His life is thus the story of where we came from-and what we stand to lose if we abandon the ideals for which he fought."}, {"rank": 5, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "152474672X", "primary_isbn13": "9781524746728", "publisher": "Dutton", "description": "The medical director of Stanford Addiction Medicine explores the neuroscience and behaviors that inform the relationship between pleasure and pain.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Dopamine Nation", "author": "Anna Lembke", "contributor": "by Anna Lembke", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781524746728.jpg", "book_image_width": 334, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/152474672X?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "152474672X", "isbn13": "9781524746728"}, {"isbn10": "1524746738", "isbn13": "9781524746735"}, {"isbn10": "1524746746", "isbn13": "9781524746742"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/152474672X?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781524746728?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781524746728"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FDOPAMINE%2BNATION%2FAnna%2BLembke%2F9781524746728"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781524746728"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781524746728?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/9875cead-d541-5d4c-932e-c84c035f8f3e", "list_date": "2021/09/12", "published_data": "2021-08-24", "summary": "INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES and LOS ANGELES TIMES BESTSELLER \u201cBrilliant . . . riveting, scary, cogent, and cleverly argued.\u201d\u2014Beth Macy, author of Dopesick, as heard on Fresh Air This book is about pleasure. It\u2019s also about pain. Most important, it\u2019s about how to find the delicate balance between the two, and why now more than ever finding balance is essential. We\u2019re living in a time of unprecedented access to high-reward, high-dopamine stimuli: drugs, food, news, gambling, shopping, gaming, texting, sexting, Facebooking, Instagramming, YouTubing, tweeting . . . The increased numbers, variety, and potency is staggering. The smartphone is the modern-day hypodermic needle, delivering digital dopamine 24/7 for a wired generation. As such we\u2019ve all become vulnerable to compulsive overconsumption. In Dopamine Nation, Dr. Anna Lembke, psychiatrist and author, explores the exciting new scientific discoveries that explain why the relentless pursuit of pleasure leads to pain . . . and what to do about it. Condensing complex neuroscience into easy-to-understand metaphors, Lembke illustrates how finding contentment and connectedness means keeping dopamine in check. The lived experiences of her patients are the gripping fabric of her narrative. Their riveting stories of suffering and redemption give us all hope for managing our consumption and transforming our lives. In essence, Dopamine Nation shows that the secret to finding balance is combining the science of desire with the wisdom of recovery."}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 2, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1546090789", "primary_isbn13": "9781546090786", "publisher": "Center Street", "description": "The founder and executive chairman of the biopharmaceutical company Roivant Sciences shares his perspectives on American capitalism.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Woke, Inc.", "author": "Vivek Ramaswamy", "contributor": "by Vivek Ramaswamy", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781546090786.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1546090789?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1546090789", "isbn13": "9781546090786"}, {"isbn10": "1546059822", "isbn13": "9781546059820"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1546090789?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781546090786?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781546090786"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FWOKE%252C%2BINC.%2FVivek%2BRamaswamy%2F9781546090786"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781546090786"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781546090786?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/1f7e0162-6fc5-5ae2-8819-b7dc35dd6054", "list_date": "2021/09/12", "published_data": "2021", "summary": "AN INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER! A young entrepreneur makes the case that politics has no place in business, and sets out a new vision for the future of American capitalism. There's a new invisible force at work in our economic and cultural lives. It affects every advertisement we see and every product we buy, from our morning coffee to a new pair of shoes. \"Stakeholder capitalism\" makes rosy promises of a better, more diverse, environmentally-friendly world, but in reality this ideology championed by America's business and political leaders robs us of our money, our voice, and our identity. Vivek Ramaswamy is a traitor to his class. He's founded multibillion-dollar enterprises, led a biotech company as CEO, he became a hedge fund partner in his 20s, trained as a scientist at Harvard and a lawyer at Yale, and grew up the child of immigrants in a small town in Ohio. Now he takes us behind the scenes into corporate boardrooms and five-star conferences, into Ivy League classrooms and secretive nonprofits, to reveal the defining scam of our century. The modern woke-industrial complex divides us as a people. By mixing morality with consumerism, America's elites prey on our innermost insecurities about who we really are. They sell us cheap social causes and skin-deep identities to satisfy our hunger for a cause and our search for meaning, at a moment when we as Americans lack both. This book not only rips back the curtain on the new corporatist agenda, it offers a better way forward. America's elites may want to sort us into demographic boxes, but we don't have to stay there. Woke, Inc. begins as a critique of stakeholder capitalism and ends with an exploration of what it means to be an American in 2021--a journey that begins with cynicism and ends with hope."}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1538719266", "primary_isbn13": "9781538719268", "publisher": "Twelve", "description": "A biography of the tennis champion Roger Federer by a New York Times tennis correspondent.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Master", "author": "Christopher Clarey", "contributor": "by Christopher Clarey", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781538719268.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1538719266?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1538719266", "isbn13": "9781538719268"}, {"isbn10": "1538719258", "isbn13": "9781538719251"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1538719266?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781538719268?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781538719268"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BMASTER%2FChristopher%2BClarey%2F9781538719268"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781538719268"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781538719268?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/43836707-7ef8-50e0-a9bd-335cb495ff1f", "list_date": "2021/09/12", "published_data": "2021-08-17", "summary": "A major biography of the greatest men's tennis player of the modern era. There have been other biographies of Roger Federer, but never one with this kind of access to the man himself, his support team, and the most prominent figures in the game, including such rivals as Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, and Andy Roddick. In THE MASTER, New York Times correspondent Christopher Clarey sits down with Federer and those closest to him to tell the story of the greatest player in men's tennis. Roger Federer has often made it look astonishingly easy through the decades: carving backhands, gliding to forehands, leaping for overheads and, in his most gravity-defying act, remaining high on a pedestal in a world of sports rightfully flooded with cynicism. But his path from temperamental, bleach-blond teenager with dubious style sense to one of the greatest, most self-possessed and elegant of competitors has been a long-running act of will, not destiny. He not only had a great gift. He had grit. Christopher Clarey, one of the top international sportswriters working today, has covered Federer since the beginning of his professional career. He was in Paris on the Suzanne Lenglen Court for Federer's first Grand Slam match and has interviewed him exclusively more than any other journalist since his rise to prominence. Here, Clarey focuses on the pivotal people, places, and moments in Federer's long and rich career: reporting from South Africa, South America, the Middle East, four Grand Slam tournaments, and Federer's native Switzerland. It has been a journey like no other player's, rife with victories and a few crushing defeats, one that has redefined enduring excellence and made Federer a sentimental favorite worldwide. THE MASTER tells the story of Federer's life and career on both an intimate and grand scale, in a way no one else could possibly do."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 7, "weeks_on_list": 6, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593298942", "primary_isbn13": "9780593298947", "publisher": "Penguin Press", "description": "The Pulitzer Prize-winning reporters examine Trump\u2019s final year in office, with a focus on the key players around him.", "price": "0.00", "title": "I Alone Can Fix It", "author": "Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker", "contributor": "by Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593298947.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593298942?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593298942", "isbn13": "9780593298947"}, {"isbn10": "0593298950", "isbn13": "9780593298954"}, {"isbn10": "0593505069", "isbn13": "9780593505069"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593298942?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593298947?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593298947"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FI%2BALONE%2BCAN%2BFIX%2BIT%2FCarol%2BLeonnig%2Band%2BPhilip%2BRucker%2F9780593298947"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593298947"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593298947?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/9c301301-0003-5688-9e1b-f36b07eb2890", "list_date": "2021/09/12", "published_data": "2021-07-20", "summary": "The instant #1 New York Times bestseller | A Washington Post Notable Book | One of NPR's Best Books of 2021 The definitive behind-the-scenes story of Trump's final year in office, by Phil Rucker and Carol Leonnig, the Pulitzer-Prize winning reporters and authors of A Very Stable Genius. \u201cChilling.\u201d \u2013 Anderson Cooper \u201cJaw-dropping.\u201d \u2013 John Berman \u201cShocking.\u201d \u2013 John Heilemann \u201cExplosive.\u201d \u2013 Hallie Jackson \u201cBlockbuster new reporting.\u201d \u2013 Nicolle Wallace \u201cBracing new revelations.\u201d \u2013 Brian Williams \u201cBombshell reporting.\u201d \u2013 David Muir The true story of what took place in Donald Trump\u2019s White House during a disastrous 2020 has never before been told in full. What was really going on around the president, as the government failed to contain the coronavirus and over half a million Americans perished? Who was influencing Trump after he refused to concede an election he had clearly lost and spread lies about election fraud? To answer these questions, Phil Rucker and Carol Leonnig reveal a dysfunctional and bumbling presidency\u2019s inner workings in unprecedented, stunning detail. Focused on Trump and the key players around him\u2014the doctors, generals, senior advisers, and Trump family members\u2014 Rucker and Leonnig provide a forensic account of the most devastating year in a presidency like no other. Their sources were in the room as time and time again Trump put his personal gain ahead of the good of the country. These witnesses to history tell the story of him longing to deploy the military to the streets of American cities to crush the protest movement in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, all to bolster his image of strength ahead of the election. These sources saw firsthand his refusal to take the threat of the coronavirus seriously\u2014even to the point of allowing himself and those around him to be infected. This is a story of a nation sabotaged\u2014economically, medically, and politically\u2014by its own leader, culminating with a groundbreaking, minute-by-minute account of exactly what went on in the Capitol building on January 6, as Trump\u2019s supporters so easily breached the most sacred halls of American democracy, and how the president reacted. With unparalleled access, Rucker and Leonnig explain and expose exactly who enabled\u2014and who foiled\u2014Trump as he sought desperately to cling to power.

But the president insisted there was nothing to worry about. Fortunately, we are still a nation of skeptics. Fortunately, there are those among us who study pandemics and are willing to look unflinchingly at worst-case scenarios. Michael Lewis\u2019s taut and brilliant nonfiction thriller pits a band of medical visionaries against the wall of ignorance that was the official response of the Trump administration to the outbreak of COVID-19. The characters you will meet in these pages are as fascinating as they are unexpected. A thirteen-year-old girl\u2019s science project on transmission of an airborne pathogen develops into a very grown-up model of disease control. A local public-health officer uses her worm\u2019s-eye view to see what the CDC misses, and reveals great truths about American society. A secret team of dissenting doctors, nicknamed the Wolverines, has everything necessary to fight the pandemic: brilliant backgrounds, world-class labs, prior experience with the pandemic scares of bird flu and swine flu\u2026everything, that is, except official permission to implement their work. Michael Lewis is not shy about calling these people heroes for their refusal to follow directives that they know to be based on misinformation and bad science. Even the internet, as crucial as it is to their exchange of ideas, poses a risk to them.

As the face of the NBA's new world order, Giannis Antetokounmpo has overcome unfathomable obstacles to become a symbol of hope for people all over the world, the personification of the American Dream. But his backstory remains largely untold, and Fader unearths new information about the childhood that shaped \"The Greek Freak\"--from sleeping side by side with his brothers to selling trinkets on the side of the street with his family to the racism he experienced in Greece. Antetokounmpo grew up in an era when Golden Dawn, Greek's far-right, anti-immigrant party, patrolled his neighborhood, and his status as an illegal immigrant largely prevented him from playing for Greek's top clubs, making his rise to the NBA all the more improbable. Fader tells a deeply-human story of how an unknown, skinny, Black-Greek teen, who played in the country's lowest pro division and was seen as a draft gamble, transformed his body and his game into MVP material. Antetokounmpo's story has been framed as a feel-good narrative in which the globe has embraced him, watching him grow up and lead the underdog Bucks to the best record in the NBA in 2020. Giannis reveals a more nuanced story: how hesitant Antetokounmpo was, and still is, to spend money; how lonely and isolated he felt, adjusting to America and the NBA early in his career; the way he changed after his father recently died of a heart attack; the complexity of grappling with his Black and Greek identities; how private he is, so hard on himself and his shortcomings, a drive that fuels him every day; and the deep-rooted responsibility he feels to be a nurturing role model for his younger brothers. Fader illustrates a more vulnerable star than people know, a person who has evolved triumphantly into all of his roles: as father, brother, son, teammate, and global icon. Giannis gives readers a front-row seat as Antetokounmpo strives for an elusive championship with the Bucks, and as he contends with his next big hurdle: to stay in Milwaukee or chase the possibility of NBA super-stardom with a major-market franchise."}, {"rank": 6, "rank_last_week": 2, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0063079429", "primary_isbn13": "9780063079427", "publisher": "Harper", "description": "The retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel recounts his actions that led to the impeachment of President Trump and his testimony before Congress.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Here, Right Matters", "author": "Alexander Vindman", "contributor": "by Alexander Vindman", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780063079427.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063079429?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0063079429", "isbn13": "9780063079427"}, {"isbn10": "0063079445", "isbn13": "9780063079441"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063079429?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780063079427?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780063079427"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FHERE%252C%2BRIGHT%2BMATTERS%2FAlexander%2BVindman%2F9780063079427"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780063079427"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780063079427?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/b41bab8b-a46c-52f3-936b-bd8cc6b54a86", "list_date": "2021/08/29", "published_data": "2021-06-15", "summary": "Retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, who found himself at the center of a firestorm for his decision to report the infamous phone call that led to presidential impeachment, tells his own story for the first time. HERE, RIGHT MATTERS is a stirring account of Vindman's childhood as an immigrant growing up in New York City, his career in service of his new home on the battlefield and at the White House , and the decisions leading up to, and fallout surrounding, his exposure of President Trump's abuse of power. 0900, Thursday, July 25, 2019: President Trump called Ukraine's President Zelensky, supposedly to congratulate him on his recent victory. In the months that followed, the American public would only learn what happened on that call because Alexander Vindman felt duty-bound to report it up the chain of command: that the President of the United States had extorted a foreign ally to damage a political challenger at home. Vindman's actions and subsequent testimony before congress would lead to Trump's impeachment and affirm Vindman's belief that he had done the right thing in the face of intense pressure to stay silent. But it would come at an enormous cost, straining relationships with colleagues, superiors, and even his own father, and eventually end his decorated career in the US Army, by a Trump administration intent on retribution. Here, Right Matters is Vindman's proud, passionate, and candid account of his family, his career, and the moment of truth he faced for his nation. As an immigrant, raised by a father who fled the Soviet Union in pursuit of a better life for his children, Vindman learned about respect for truth throughout his education and military service. As this memoir makes clear, his decision to speak up about the July 25th call was never a choice: it was Vindman's duty, as a naturalized citizen and member of the armed forces. In the wake of his testimony, he would endure furious partisan attacks on his record and his loyalty. But far louder was the extraordinary chorus of support from citizens who were collectively intent on reaffirming an abiding American commitment to integrity. In the face of a sure-fire career derailment and public excoriation, Vindman heeded the lessons from the people and institutions who instilled in him the moral compass and the courage to act decisively. Like so many other American immigrant families, the Vindmans had to learn to build a life from scratch and take big risks to achieve important goals. Here, Right Matters is about the quiet heroes who keep us safe; but, above all, it is a call to arms for those who refuse to let America betray its true self."}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0063018950", "primary_isbn13": "9780063018952", "publisher": "Dey Street", "description": "A memoir by the former Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts competitor.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Breathe", "author": "Rickson Gracie with Peter Maguire", "contributor": "by Rickson Gracie with Peter Maguire", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780063018952.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063018950?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0063018950", "isbn13": "9780063018952"}, {"isbn10": "0063018977", "isbn13": "9780063018976"}, {"isbn10": "0063018985", "isbn13": "9780063018983"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063018950?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780063018952?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780063018952"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FBREATHE%2FRickson%2BGracie%2Bwith%2BPeter%2BMaguire%2F9780063018952"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780063018952"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780063018952?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/84f01b50-1f54-57ef-bf9b-b52cae9494f3", "list_date": "2021/08/29", "published_data": "2021", "summary": "*** An Instant New York Times bestseller *** *** A USA Today bestseller *** *** A Wall Street Journal bestseller *** From legendary Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and MMA master Rickson Gracie comes a riveting, insightful memoir that weaves together the story of Gracie's stunning career with the larger history of the Gracie family dynasty and the founding of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, showing how the connection between mind and body can be harnessed for success both inside and outside the ring. Undefeated from the late 1970s through his final fight in the Tokyo Dome in 2000, Rickson Gracie amassed hundreds of victories in the street, on the mat, at the beach, and in the ring. He has joined the pantheon that includes Bruce Lee, Chuck Norris, and Jackie Chan as one of the most famous martial artists of the twentieth century. Jiu-Jitsu, the fighting style developed and pioneered by his family, has become one of the world's most prominent martial arts, and Vale Tudo, the \"anything goes\" style of Brazilian street fighting over which the Gracies had a monopoly, was an early precursor to the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Simply put, without the Gracie family, there would be no sport of \"MMA,\" no 4-billion-dollar UFC empire, and no \"Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu\" at strip malls all across America. In Breathe, for the first time, Rickson reveals the full story of how his father and uncles came to develop Jiu-Jitsu, what it was like to grow up among several generations of world-renowned fighters from the Gracie clan, and the principles and skills that guided him to his undefeated record. From learning to assert himself on the streets of Rio to gaining fame and honor in Japan and emerging through heartbreaking tragedy, the martial arts master shares tales of overcoming challenges, extolling universal virtues and showing readers how pride and ego are the enemies of success. With never-before-seen photos and profound insights into the sport and way of life that only a studied legend can provide, Breathe is an entertaining and magnified view of an enduring legacy as well as an inspiring tale of weathering life's complexities and overcoming them with style and grace."}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 7, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10":

From 1915 to 1970, this exodus of almost six million people changed the face of America. Wilkerson compares this epic migration to the migrations of other peoples in history. She interviewed more than a thousand people, and gained access to new data and official records, to write this definitive and vividly dramatic account of how these American journeys unfolded, altering our cities, our country, and ourselves. With stunning historical detail, Wilkerson tells this story through the lives of three unique individuals: Ida Mae Gladney, who in 1937 left sharecropping and prejudice in Mississippi for Chicago, where she achieved quiet blue-collar success and, in old age, voted for Barack Obama when he ran for an Illinois Senate seat; sharp and quick-tempered George Starling, who in 1945 fled Florida for Harlem, where he endangered his job fighting for civil rights, saw his family fall, and finally found peace in God; and Robert Foster, who left Louisiana in 1953 to pursue a medical career, the personal physician to Ray Charles as part of a glitteringly successful medical career, which allowed him to purchase a grand home where he often threw exuberant parties. Wilkerson brilliantly captures their first treacherous and exhausting cross-country trips by car and train and their new lives in colonies that grew into ghettos, as well as how they changed these cities with southern food, faith, and culture and improved them with discipline, drive, and hard work. Both a riveting microcosm and a major assessment, The Warmth of Other Suns is a bold, remarkable, and riveting work, a superb account of an \u201cunrecognized immigration\u201d within our own land. Through the breadth of its narrative, the beauty of the writing, the depth of its research, and the fullness of the people and lives portrayed herein, this book is destined to become a classic."}, {"rank": 7, "rank_last_week": 3, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "125083001X", "primary_isbn13": "9781250830012", "publisher": "Holt", "description": "The author of \u201cFire and Fury\u201d and \u201cSiege\u201d portrays events during the final days of Trump\u2019s presidency.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Landslide", "author": "Michael Wolff", "contributor": "by Michael Wolff", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781250830012.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/125083001X?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "125083001X", "isbn13": "9781250830012"}, {"isbn10": "1250830036", "isbn13": "9781250830036"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/125083001X?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781250830012?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781250830012"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FLANDSLIDE%2FMichael%2BWolff%2F9781250830012"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781250830012"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250830012?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/f6fc481e-d549-5043-bc2e-037c56221639", "list_date": "2021/08/15", "published_data": "2021-07-13", "summary": "\"The final days of the Trump presidency\"--Jacket."}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 6, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "153873480X", "primary_isbn13": "9781538734803", "publisher": "Twelve", "description": "A senior White House reporter for The Wall Street Journal looks at Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign and final year in office.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Frankly, We Did Win This Election", "author": "Michael C.

In November 2018, the New York Times published a bombshell in-depth investigation that exposed, with disturbing insider detail, how leadership decisions at Facebook enabled, and then tried to cover up, massive privacy breaches and Russian meddling in the 2016 election. The story quickly shot to the top of the paper's most emailed list. It would earn the team of Times reporters a prestigious Loeb award, the George Polk award, and a spot on the Pulitzer short list. But it only skimmed the surface. The investigation's lead reporters, Sheera Frenkel and Cecilia Kang, spent eighteen months piecing together the story of how one of the most powerful companies in the world tried to bury a damning truth--that Facebook has become a conduit for disinformation, hate speech, and political propaganda. The unrivaled sources of these two veteran journalists led them to perhaps the most recognizable names in the tech industry: Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg. Both have long existed as archetypes of uniquely twenty-first century executives--he, the tech \"boy genius\" turned billionaire, she, the ultimate woman in business, an inspiration to millions through her books and speeches. At Any Cost is the definitive story of Facebook's fall from grace, following the embattled company from 2011, when its power and positive influence was undisputed, to 2020, when it will face its biggest test yet--the US presidential election. What are the ultimate ramifications when a few individuals are in charge of the technology used by half the world's population? Can they control the technology they've unleashed into the world? And if not, can we, as individuals and as a society, control them?"}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 4, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1982150823", "primary_isbn13": "9781982150822", "publisher": "Atria", "description": "The screen actor describes how his past, which includes heroin addiction and prison time, has informed some of his roles.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Trejo", "author": "Danny Trejo with Donal Logue", "contributor": "by Danny Trejo with Donal Logue", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781982150822.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982150823?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1982150823", "isbn13": "9781982150822"}, {"isbn10": "198215084X", "isbn13": "9781982150846"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982150823?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781982150822?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781982150822"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTREJO%2FDanny%2BTrejo%2Bwith%2BDonal%2BLogue%2F9781982150822"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781982150822"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781982150822?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/838d0a4c-7f44-5b6e-b86a-4e1579fb73dc", "list_date": "2021/08/01", "published_data": "2021-07-06", "summary": "\"For the first time, the full, fascinating, and inspirational true story of Danny Trejo's journey from crime, prison, addiction, and loss to unexpected fame as Hollywood's favorite bad guy with a heart of gold\"--"}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1954118007", "primary_isbn13": "9781954118003", "publisher": "Spiegel & Grau", "description": "A former national park ranger details her friendship with a wild fox in an isolated part of Montana.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Fox And I", "author": "Catherine Raven", "contributor": "by Catherine Raven", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781954118003.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1954118007?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1954118007", "isbn13": "9781954118003"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1954118007?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781954118003?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781954118003"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FFOX%2BAND%2BI%2FCatherine%2BRaven%2F9781954118003"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781954118003"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781954118003?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/baec7604-ad67-5fa6-bd53-8bea17213819", "list_date": "2021/07/25", "published_data": "2021-06-30", "summary": "A wild fox befriends a solitary woman at her home in Montana, and their relationship transforms them both in this inspiring, surprising, and often funny memoir. Both a new window onto the natural world and the introduction of a remarkable literary talent.Catherine Raven left home at 15, fleeing an abusive, disdainful father and an indifferent mother. More at home in nature than among people, she worked for many years as a National Parks ranger, eventually earning a Ph.D. in biology while working as a janitor and living in her car (which lacked a reverse gear) or on abandoned construction sites. She built a house on an isolated plot of land in Montana, teaching remotely and leading field courses in the National Parks. One day, she realized that the mangy-looking fox who had been appearing on her property was now showing up every day at 4:15, positioning himself near a lone forget-me-not near the house. She had never had a regular visitor before. How do you even talk to a fox? One day she brought out her camping chair, sat as near to him as she dared, and began reading to him from The Little Prince. Her scientific training had taught her not to anthropomorphize animals, yet as she grew to know him, his personality revealed itself--and he became her friend. But friends cannot always save each other from the uncontained forces of nature. Fox and I is also a poignant and dramatic tale of coping with inevitable loss and how that loss can be transformed into meaning. An uplifting, fable-like true story, it not only reveals the power of friendship and our interconnectedness with the natural world but introduces an original, imaginative, stunning new literary voice."}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1984880098", "primary_isbn13": "9781984880093", "publisher": "Penguin Press", "description": "A re-examination of the events of the Battle of the Alamo that challenges a commonly understood version of them.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Forget The Alamo", "author": "Bryan Burrough, Chris Tomlinson and Jason Stanford", "contributor": "by Bryan Burrough, Chris Tomlinson and Jason Stanford", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781984880093.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1984880098?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1984880098", "isbn13": "9781984880093"}, {"isbn10": "1984880101", "isbn13": "9781984880109"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1984880098?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781984880093?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781984880093"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FFORGET%2BTHE%2BALAMO%2FBryan%2BBurrough%252C%2BChris%2BTomlinson%2Band%2BJason%2BStanford%2F9781984880093"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781984880093"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781984880093?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/f1eafdef-989c-5cb0-a31f-d3015cd21f64", "list_date": "2021/07/25", "published_data": "2021-06-08", "summary": "A New York Times bestseller! \u201cLively and absorbing. . .\" \u2014 The New York Times Book Review \"Engrossing.\" \u2014Wall Street Journal \u201cEntertaining and well-researched . . . \u201d \u2014Houston Chronicle Three noted Texan writers combine forces to tell the real story of the Alamo, dispelling the myths, exploring why they had their day for so long, and explaining why the ugly fight about its meaning is now coming to a head. Every nation needs its creation myth, and since Texas was a nation before it was a state, it's no surprise that its myths bite deep. There's no piece of history more important to Texans than the Battle of the Alamo, when Davy Crockett and a band of rebels went down in a blaze of glory fighting for independence from Mexico, losing the battle but setting Texas up to win the war. However, that version of events, as Forget the Alamo definitively shows, owes more to fantasy than reality. Just as the site of the Alamo was left in ruins for decades, its story was forgotten and twisted over time, with the contributions of Tejanos--Texans of Mexican origin, who fought alongside the Anglo rebels--scrubbed from the record, and the origin of the conflict over Mexico's push to abolish slavery papered over. Forget the Alamo provocatively explains the true story of the battle against the backdrop of Texas's struggle for independence, then shows how the sausage of myth got made in the Jim Crow South of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. As uncomfortable as it may be to hear for some, celebrating the Alamo has long had an echo of celebrating whiteness. In the past forty-some years, waves of revisionists have come at this topic, and at times have made real progress toward a more nuanced and inclusive story that doesn't alienate anyone. But we are not living in one of those times; the fight over the Alamo's meaning has become more pitched than ever in the past few years, even violent, as Texas's future begins to look more and more different from its past. It's the perfect time for a wise and generous-spirited book that shines the bright light of the truth into a place that's gotten awfully dark."}, {"rank": 1, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "006306605X", "primary_isbn13": "9780063066052", "publisher": "Harper", "description": "Two Washington Post journalists give an account of the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Nightmare Scenario", "author": "Yasmeen Abutaleb and Damian Paletta", "contributor": "by Yasmeen Abutaleb and Damian Paletta", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780063066052.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/006306605X?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "006306605X", "isbn13": "9780063066052"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/006306605X?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780063066052?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780063066052"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FNIGHTMARE%2BSCENARIO%2FYasmeen%2BAbutaleb%2Band%2BDamian%2BPaletta%2F9780063066052"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780063066052"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780063066052?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/50f13b17-c0c3-5dcc-991e-37ddc5c518cb", "list_date": "2021/07/18", "published_data": "2021-06-29", "summary": "N/A"}, {"rank": 3, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0062958690", "primary_isbn13": "9780062958693", "publisher": "Dey Street", "description": "The soccer commentator describes how he embraced American popular culture while growing up in Liverpool.", "price": "0.00", "title": "(Re)Born In The Usa", "author": "Roger Bennett", "contributor": "by Roger Bennett", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780062958693.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062958690?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0062958690", "isbn13": "9780062958693"}, {"isbn10": "0062958720", "isbn13": "9780062958723"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062958690?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780062958693?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780062958693"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2F%2528RE%2529BORN%2BIN%2BTHE%2BUSA%2FRoger%2BBennett%2F9780062958693"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780062958693"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062958693?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/3e66abb0-b5fc-53ff-90b0-27396777470f", "list_date": "2021/07/18", "published_data": "2021", "summary": "One-half of the celebrated Men in Blazers duo, longtime culture and soccer commentator Roger Bennett traces the origins of his love affair with America, and how he went from a depraved, pimply faced Jewish boy in 1980's Liverpool to become the quintessential Englishman in New York. A memoir for fans of Jon Ronson and Chuck Klosterman, but with Roger Bennett's signature pop culture flair and humor. One of the earliest beliefs that I still cling onto in life, is that I was born a American trapped in an Englishman's body. That is the kind of story you manufacture about yourself when you grow up in a place like Liverpool in the 1980's. Reborn in the USA is Roger Bennett's homage to an adolescence as a triple outsider (Jewish in largely Catholic Liverpool, middle class in an overwhelmingly working-class community, and obsessed with American culture while his peers tended towards more deviant, borderline hooligan, behavior.) Throw in the fact that his father was a judge who campaigned on behalf of Margaret Thatcher in a town who thought of her as Medusa--the perfect recipe for ostracism. Bennett was happiest when playing chess with his grandfather, watching The Love Boat and Miami Vice, reading his hoarded copies of Rolling Stone, and blasting John Mellencamp's Scarecrow, Public Enemy's Yo! Bum Rush the Show, or Tracy Chapman's debut Fast Car. An American stuck in his native England. Bennett gives voice to every teenager who longs to leave their hometown behind, who pines for a different life, and who will do just about anything to escape what makes their formative years awful. In this funny and moving book, he beautifully captures the universality of growing pains, growing up, and growing out of where you come from. And when given the chance to taste the sweet fruit of his dream and travel to the USofA, Bennett expresses the reckless abandon that prevails when youth experiences freedom (and The Beastie Boys) for the first time. Rich with late '80s and '90s pop culture references from both sides of the pond--and with Roger's over-the-top sense of humor--Reborn in the USA is both a truly unique coming-of-age story in the vein of Jon Ronson and Chuck Klosterman and the love letter to America that this country needs right now."}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593230809", "primary_isbn13": "9780593230800", "publisher": "One World", "description": "A journalist for The Atlantic examines the historic forces that fed the intentions of the Trump administration.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Cruelty Is The Point", "author": "Adam Serwer", "contributor": "by Adam Serwer", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593230800.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593230809?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593230809", "isbn13": "9780593230800"}, {"isbn10": "0593230817", "isbn13": "9780593230817"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593230809?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593230800?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593230800"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BCRUELTY%2BIS%2BTHE%2BPOINT%2FAdam%2BSerwer%2F9780593230800"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593230800"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593230800?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/438abd17-be77-5cc6-b7d0-c50468de2973", "list_date": "2021/07/18", "published_data": "2021-06-29", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 From an award-winning journalist at The Atlantic, these searing essays make a powerful case that \u201creal hope lies not in a sunny nostalgia for American greatness but in seeing this history plain\u2014in all of its brutality, unadorned by euphemism\u201d (The New York Times). NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR \u2022 \u201cNo writer better demonstrates how American dreams are so often sabotaged by American history. Adam Serwer is essential.\u201d\u2014Ta-Nehisi Coates To many, our most shocking political crises appear unprecedented\u2014un-American, even. But they are not, writes The Atlantic\u2019s Adam Serwer in this prescient essay collection, which dissects the most devastating moments in recent memory to reveal deeply entrenched dynamics, patterns as old as the country itself. The January 6 insurrection, anti-immigrant sentiment, and American authoritarianism all have historic roots that explain their continued power with or without President Donald Trump\u2014a fact borne out by what has happened since his departure from the White House. Serwer argues that Trump is not the cause, he is a symptom. Serwer\u2019s phrase \u201cthe cruelty is the point\u201d became among the most-used descriptions of Trump\u2019s era, but as this book demonstrates, it resonates across centuries. The essays here combine revelatory reporting, searing analysis, and a clarity that\u2019s bracing. In this new, expanded version of his bestselling debut, Serwer elegantly dissects white supremacy\u2019s profound influence on our political system, looking at the persistence of the Lost Cause, the past and present of police unions, the mythology of migration, and the many faces of anti-Semitism. In so doing, he offers abundant proof that our past is present and demonstrates the devastating costs of continuing to pretend it\u2019s not.

The Anthropocene Reviewed is a open-hearted exploration of the paths we forge and an unironic celebration of falling in love with the world.

It is the story of the Monticello Plantation in Virginia, the estate where Thomas Jefferson wrote letters espousing the urgent need for liberty while enslaving over 400 people on the premises. It is the story of the Whitney Plantation, one of the only former plantations devoted to preserving the experience of the enslaved people whose lives and work sustained it. It is the story of Angola Prison in Louisiana, a former plantation named for the country from which most of its enslaved people arrived and which has since become one of the most gruesome maximum-security prisons in the world. And it is the story of Blandford Cemetery, the final resting place of tens of thousands of Confederate soldiers. In a deeply researched and transporting exploration of the legacy of slavery and its imprint on centuries of American history, How the Word Is Passed illustrates how some of our country's most essential stories are hidden in plain view-whether in places we might drive by on our way to work, holidays such as Juneteenth, or entire neighborhoods--like downtown Manhattan--on which the brutal history of the trade in enslaved men, women and children has been deeply imprinted. Informed by scholarship and brought alive by the story of people living today, Clint Smith's debut work of nonfiction is a landmark work of reflection and insight that offers a new understanding of the hopeful role that memory and history can play in understanding our country."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 10, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1631498835", "primary_isbn13": "9781631498831", "publisher": "Liveright", "description": "The Pulitzer Prize winner weaves together American history with personal memoir to show the importance of events in Galveston, Texas, on June 19, 1865.", "price": "0.00", "title": "On Juneteenth", "author": "Annette Gordon-Reed", "contributor": "by Annette Gordon-Reed", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781631498831.jpg", "book_image_width": 308, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1631498835?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1631498835", "isbn13": "9781631498831"}, {"isbn10": "1631498843", "isbn13": "9781631498848"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1631498835?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781631498831?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781631498831"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FON%2BJUNETEENTH%2FAnnette%2BGordon-Reed%2F9781631498831"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781631498831"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781631498831?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/2f62e489-52f8-51a2-b90c-ea3574433347", "list_date": "2021/07/11", "published_data": "2021-05-04", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER The essential, sweeping story of Juneteenth\u2019s integral importance to American history, as told by a Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning historian and Texas native. Weaving together American history, dramatic family chronicle, and searing episodes of memoir, Annette Gordon-Reed\u2019s On Juneteenth provides a historian\u2019s view of the country\u2019s long road to Juneteenth, recounting both its origins in Texas and the enormous hardships that African-Americans have endured in the century since, from Reconstruction through Jim Crow and beyond. All too aware of the stories of cowboys, ranchers, and oilmen that have long dominated the lore of the Lone Star State, Gordon-Reed\u2014herself a Texas native and the descendant of enslaved people brought to Texas as early as the 1820s\u2014forges a new and profoundly truthful narrative of her home state, with implications for us all. Combining personal anecdotes with poignant facts gleaned from the annals of American history, Gordon-Reed shows how, from the earliest presence of Black people in Texas to the day in Galveston on June 19, 1865, when Major General Gordon Granger announced the end of legalized slavery in the state, African-Americans played an integral role in the Texas story. Reworking the traditional \u201cAlamo\u201d framework, she powerfully demonstrates, among other things, that the slave- and race-based economy not only defined the fractious era of Texas independence but precipitated the Mexican-American War and, indeed, the Civil War itself. In its concision, eloquence, and clear presentation of history, On Juneteenth vitally revises conventional renderings of Texas and national history. As our nation verges on recognizing June 19 as a national holiday, On Juneteenth is both an essential account and a stark reminder that the fight for equality is exigent and ongoing."}, {"rank": 2, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0063078252", "primary_isbn13": "9780063078253", "publisher": "Harper", "description": "The wife of the late Broadway star Nick Cordero recounts his battle with Covid-19 and the hope she found in her infant son, Elvis.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Live Your Life", "author": "Amanda Kloots with Anna Kloots", "contributor": "by Amanda Kloots with Anna Kloots", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780063078253.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063078252?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0063078252", "isbn13": "9780063078253"}, {"isbn10": "0063078279", "isbn13": "9780063078277"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063078252?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780063078253?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780063078253"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FLIVE%2BYOUR%2BLIFE%2FAmanda%2BKloots%2Bwith%2BAnna%2BKloots%2F9780063078253"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780063078253"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780063078253?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/01dc4127-9472-50a2-b94f-98751d2f4f22", "list_date": "2021/07/04", "published_data": "2021-06-15", "summary": "In March 2020, Tony Award nominee Nick Cordero was hospitalized for what he and his wife, Amanda Kloots, believed to be a severe case of pneumonia.

The show\u2019s vibrant mix of Latin music and hip-hop captured life in Washington Heights, the Latino neighborhood in upper Manhattan. It won four Tony Awards and became an international hit, delighting audiences around the world. For the film version, director Jon M. Chu (Crazy Rich Asians) brought the story home, filming its spectacular dance numbers on location in Washington Heights. That\u2019s where Usnavi, Nina, and their neighbors chase their dreams and ask a universal question: Where do I belong? In the Heights: Finding Home reunites Miranda with Jeremy McCarter, co-author of Hamilton: The Revolution, and Quiara Alegr\u00eda Hudes, the Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning librettist of the Broadway musical and screenwriter of the film. They do more than trace the making of an unlikely Broadway smash and a major motion picture: They give readers an intimate look at the decades-long creative life of In the Heights. Like Hamilton: The Revolution, the book offers untold stories, perceptive essays, and the lyrics to Miranda\u2019s songs\u2014complete with his funny, heartfelt annotations. It also features newly commissioned portraits and never-before-seen photos from backstage, the movie set, and productions around the world.

Through poverty, adolescence, and a fraught relationship with her mother, Ashley C. Ford wishes she could turn to her father for hope and encouragement. There are just a few problems: he\u2019s in prison, and she doesn\u2019t know what he did to end up there. She doesn\u2019t know how to deal with the incessant worries that keep her up at night, or how to handle the changes in her body that draw unwanted attention from men. In her search for unconditional love, Ashley begins dating a boy her mother hates. When the relationship turns sour, he assaults her. Still reeling from the rape, which she keeps secret from her family, Ashley desperately searches for meaning in the chaos. Then, her grandmother reveals the truth about her father\u2019s incarceration . . . and Ashley\u2019s entire world is turned upside down. Somebody\u2019s Daughter steps into the world of growing up a poor Black girl in Indiana with a family fragmented by incarceration, exploring how isolating and complex such a childhood can be. As Ashley battles her body and her environment, she embarks on a powerful journey to find the threads between who she is and what she was born into, and the complicated familial love that often binds them."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 3, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1984856057", "primary_isbn13": "9781984856050", "publisher": "Random House", "description": "A former White House aide and close confidant to President Barack Obama traveled the globe to discover just how much America\u2019s fingerprints are on the world we shaped.", "price": "0.00", "title": "After The Fall", "author": "Ben Rhodes", "contributor": "by Ben Rhodes", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781984856050.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1984856057?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1984856057", "isbn13": "9781984856050"}, {"isbn10": "1984856065", "isbn13": "9781984856067"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1984856057?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781984856050?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781984856050"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FAFTER%2BTHE%2BFALL%2FBen%2BRhodes%2F9781984856050"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781984856050"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781984856050?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/70cb185d-f82c-5701-8da2-2222fbe4cb8d", "list_date": "2021/06/27", "published_data": "2021-06-01", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 \u201cVital reading for Americans and people anywhere who seek to understand what is happening \u2018after the fall\u2019 of the global system created by the United States\u201d (New York Journal of Books), from the former White House aide, close confidant to President Barack Obama, and author of The World as It Is At a time when democracy in the United States is endangered as never before, Ben Rhodes spent years traveling the world to understand why. He visited dozens of countries, meeting with politicians and activists confronting the same nationalism and authoritarianism that are tearing America apart. Along the way, he discusses the growing authoritarianism of Vladimir Putin, and his aggression towards Ukraine, with the foremost opposition leader in Russia, who was subsequently poisoned and imprisoned; he profiled Hong Kong protesters who saw their movement snuffed out by China under Xi Jinping; and America itself reached the precipice of losing democracy before giving itself a fragile second chance. The characters and issues that Rhodes illuminates paint a picture that shows us where we are today\u2014from Barack Obama to a rising generation of international leaders; from the authoritarian playbook endangering democracy to the flood of disinformation enabling authoritarianism. Ultimately, Rhodes writes personally and powerfully about finding hope in the belief that looking squarely at where America has gone wrong can make clear how essential it is to fight for what America is supposed to be, for our own country and the entire world."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 12, "weeks_on_list": 4, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0399589015", "primary_isbn13": "9780399589010", "publisher": "Random House", "description": "The three-time Pulitzer Prize winner brings to light the secrets, scandals and shortcomings of the Secret Service.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Zero Fail", "author": "Carol Leonnig", "contributor": "by Carol Leonnig", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780399589010.jpg", "book_image_width": 334, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0399589015?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0399589015", "isbn13": "9780399589010"}, {"isbn10": "0399589023", "isbn13": "9780399589027"}, {"isbn10": "0593414128", "isbn13": "9780593414125"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0399589015?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780399589010?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780399589010"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FZERO%2BFAIL%2FCarol%2BLeonnig%2F9780399589010"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780399589010"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780399589010?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/2bb7ce01-96cb-5fbe-883f-f1512e5543be", "list_date": "2021/06/27", "published_data": "2021-05-18", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 \u201cThis is one of those books that will go down as the seminal work\u2014the determinative work\u2014in this field. . . .

But the Secret Service wasn\u2019t always so troubled. The Secret Service was born in 1865, in the wake of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, but its story begins in earnest in 1963, with the death of John F. Kennedy. Shocked into reform by its failure to protect the president on that fateful day in Dallas, this once-sleepy agency was radically transformed into an elite, highly trained unit that would redeem itself several times, most famously in 1981 by thwarting an assassination attempt against Ronald Reagan. But this reputation for courage and excellence would not last forever. By Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, the once-proud Secret Service was running on fumes and beset by mistakes and alarming lapses in judgment: break-ins at the White House, an armed gunman firing into the windows of the residence while confused agents stood by, and a massive prostitution scandal among agents in Cartagena, to name just a few. With Donald Trump\u2019s arrival, a series of promised reforms were cast aside, as a president disdainful of public service instead abused the Secret Service to rack up political and personal gains. To explore these problems in the ranks, Leonnig interviewed dozens of current and former agents, government officials, and whistleblowers who put their jobs on the line to speak out about a hobbled agency that\u2019s in desperate need of reform. \u201cI will be forever grateful to them for risking their careers,\u201d she writes, \u201cnot because they wanted to share tantalizing gossip about presidents and their families, but because they know that the Service is broken and needs fixing. By telling their story, they hope to revive the Service they love.\u201d"}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0358423880", "primary_isbn13": "9780358423881", "publisher": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", "description": "The singer-songwriter\u2019s memoir sheds light on her fraught childhood, musical triumphs and activism.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Rememberings", "author": "Sinead O\u2019Connor", "contributor": "by Sinead O\u2019Connor", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780358423881.jpg", "book_image_width": 333, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0358423880?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0358423880", "isbn13": "9780358423881"}, {"isbn10": "0358450535", "isbn13": "9780358450535"}, {"isbn10": "0358447097", "isbn13": "9780358447092"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0358423880?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780358423881?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780358423881"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FREMEMBERINGS%2FSinead%2BO%25E2%2580%2599Connor%2F9780358423881"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780358423881"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780358423881?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/cc708ae4-a8c1-551c-9fed-ab24dab9355f", "list_date": "2021/06/20", "published_data": "2021", "summary": "From the acclaimed, controversial singer-songwriter Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor comes a revelatory memoir of her fraught childhood, musical triumphs, fearless activism, and of the enduring power of song.

In Rememberings, O'Connor recounts her painful tale of growing up in Dublin in a dysfunctional, abusive household. Inspired by a brother's Bob Dylan records, she escaped into music. She relates her early forays with local Irish bands; we see Sin\u00e9ad completing her first album while eight months pregnant, hanging with Rastas in the East Village, and soaring to unimaginable popularity with her cover of Prince's \"Nothing Compares 2U.\" Intimate, replete with candid anecdotes and told in a singular form true to her unconventional career, Sin\u00e9ad's memoir is a remarkable chronicle of an enduring and influential artist."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 10, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0316451401", "primary_isbn13": "9780316451406", "publisher": "Little, Brown Spark", "description": "What might cause variability in judgments that should be identical and potential ways to remedy this.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Noise", "author": "Daniel Kahneman, Olivier Sibony and Cass R.

Suppose that different food inspectors give different ratings to indistinguishable restaurants -- or that when a company is handling customer complaints, the resolution depends on who happens to be handling the particular complaint. Now imagine that the same doctor, the same judge, the same inspector, or the same company official makes different decisions, depending on whether it is morning or afternoon, or Monday rather than Wednesday. These are examples of noise: variability in judgments that should be identical. In Noise, Daniel Kahneman, Cass R. Sunstein, and Olivier Sibony show how noise contributes significantly to errors in all fields, including medicine, law, economic forecasting, police behavior, food safety, bail, security checks at airports, strategy, and personnel selection. And although noise can be found wherever people make judgments and decisions, individuals and organizations alike are commonly oblivious to the role of chance in their judgments and in their actions. Drawing on the latest findings in psychology and behavioral economics, and the same kind of diligent, insightful research that made Thinking, Fast and Slow and Nudge groundbreaking New York Times bestsellers, Noise explains how and why humans are so susceptible to noise in judgment -- and what we can do about it."}, {"rank": 9, "rank_last_week": 7, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1984825402", "primary_isbn13": "9781984825407", "publisher": "Crown", "description": "A collection of personal essays by the actor, writer, producer, director, entrepreneur and philanthropist.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Yearbook", "author": "Seth Rogen", "contributor": "by Seth Rogen", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781984825407.jpg", "book_image_width": 388, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1984825402?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1984825402", "isbn13": "9781984825407"}, {"isbn10": "1984825410", "isbn13": "9781984825414"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1984825402?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781984825407?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781984825407"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FYEARBOOK%2FSeth%2BRogen%2F9781984825407"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781984825407"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781984825407?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/8e1a5509-50d3-5189-9034-79840d973469", "list_date": "2021/06/13", "published_data": "2021-05-11", "summary": "#2 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER* \u2022 \u201cRogen\u2019s candid collection of sidesplitting essays . . . thrives at both explaining and encapsulating a generational comedic voice.\u201d\u2014The Washington Post A collection of funny personal essays from one of the writers of Superbad and Pineapple Express and one of the producers of The Disaster Artist, Neighbors, and The Boys.

I was asked to describe my book, Yearbook, for the inside flap (which is a gross phrase) and for websites and shit like that, so\u2026 here it goes!!! Yearbook is a collection of true stories that I desperately hope are just funny at worst, and life-changingly amazing at best. (I understand that it\u2019s likely the former, which is a fancy \u201cbook\u201d way of saying \u201cthe first one.\u201d) I talk about my grandparents, doing stand-up comedy as a teenager, bar mitzvahs, and Jewish summer camp, and tell way more stories about doing drugs than my mother would like. I also talk about some of my adventures in Los Angeles, and surely say things about other famous people that will create a wildly awkward conversation for me at a party one day. I hope you enjoy the book should you buy it, and if you don\u2019t enjoy it, I\u2019m sorry. If you ever see me on the street and explain the situation, I\u2019ll do my best to make it up to you. *I was beaten by Bill O\u2019Reilly, which really sucks."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1984879057", "primary_isbn13": "9781984879059", "publisher": "Penguin Press", "description": "The ways geometry might give a better understanding of scientific, political and philosophical problems.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Shape", "author": "Jordan Ellenberg", "contributor": "by Jordan Ellenberg", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781984879059.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1984879057?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1984879057", "isbn13": "9781984879059"}, {"isbn10": "1984879065", "isbn13": "9781984879066"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1984879057?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781984879059?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781984879059"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FSHAPE%2FJordan%2BEllenberg%2F9781984879059"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781984879059"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781984879059?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/1bbdf5e7-3faa-58ef-bcbf-5d9a2246b3eb", "list_date": "2021/06/13", "published_data": "2021-05-25", "summary": "An instant New York Times Bestseller! \u201cUnreasonably entertaining . . . reveals how geometric thinking can allow for everything from fairer American elections to better pandemic planning.\u201d \u2014The New York Times From the New York Times-bestselling author of How Not to Be Wrong\u2014himself a world-class geometer\u2014a far-ranging exploration of the power of geometry, which turns out to help us think better about practically everything. How should a democracy choose its representatives? How can you stop a pandemic from sweeping the world? How do computers learn to play Go, and why is learning Go so much easier for them than learning to read a sentence? Can ancient Greek proportions predict the stock market? (Sorry, no.) What should your kids learn in school if they really want to learn to think? All these are questions about geometry. For real. If you're like most people, geometry is a sterile and dimly remembered exercise you gladly left behind in the dust of ninth grade, along with your braces and active romantic interest in pop singers. If you recall any of it, it's plodding through a series of miniscule steps only to prove some fact about triangles that was obvious to you in the first place. That's not geometry. Okay, it is geometry, but only a tiny part, which has as much to do with geometry in all its flush modern richness as conjugating a verb has to do with a great novel. Shape reveals the geometry underneath some of the most important scientific, political, and philosophical problems we face. Geometry asks: Where are things? Which things are near each other?

In the days and months after Pearl Harbor, the lives of Japanese Americans across the continent and Hawaii were changed forever. In this unforgettable chronicle of war-time America and the battlefields of Europe, Daniel James Brown portrays the journey of Rudy Tokiwa, Fred Shiosaki, and Kats Miho, who volunteered for the 442nd Regimental Combat Team and were deployed to France, Germany, and Italy, where they were asked to do the near impossible. Brown also tells the story of these soldiers' parents, immigrants who were forced to submit to life in concentration camps on U.S. soil.

The iconic group of ingenues and heartthrobs that included Rob Lowe, Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, and Demi Moore, and has come to represent both a genre of film and an era of pop culture. In his memoir Brat: An '80s Story, McCarthy focuses his gaze on that singular moment in time. The result is a revealing look at coming of age in a maelstrom, reckoning with conflicted ambition, innocence, addiction, and masculinity. New York City of the 1980's is brought to vivid life in these pages -- scoring loose joints in Washington Square Park and skipping school in favor of the dark revival houses of the Village where he fell in love with the movies that would change his life. Filled with personal revelations of innocence lost to heady days in Hollywood with John Hughes and an iconic cast of characters, Brat is a surprising and intimate story of an outsider caught up in a most unwitting success."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0063097680", "primary_isbn13": "9780063097681", "publisher": "Harper", "description": "A memoir by a survivor of a concentration camp in Auschwitz, who is currently 101 years old.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Happiest Man On Earth", "author": "Eddie Jaku", "contributor": "by Eddie Jaku", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780063097681.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063097680?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0063097680", "isbn13": "9780063097681"}, {"isbn10": "0063097702", "isbn13": "9780063097704"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0063097680?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780063097681?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780063097681"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BHAPPIEST%2BMAN%2BON%2BEARTH%2FEddie%2BJaku%2F9780063097681"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780063097681"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780063097681?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/742daf9d-ef57-52a9-ae36-2c1f7193aec3", "list_date": "2021/05/30", "published_data": "2021-05-04", "summary": "In this uplifting memoir in the vein of The Last Lecture and Man's Search for Meaning, a Holocaust survivor pays tribute to those who were lost by telling his story, sharing his wisdom, and living his best possible life. Born in Leipzig, Germany, into a Jewish family, Eddie Jaku was a teenager when his world was turned upside-down. On November 9, 1938, during the terrifying violence of Kristallnacht, the Night of Broken Glass, Eddie was beaten by SS thugs, arrested, and sent to a concentration camp with thousands of other Jews across Germany. Every day of the next seven years of his life, Eddie faced unimaginable horrors in Buchenwald, Auschwitz, and finally on a forced death march during the Third Reich's final days. The Nazis took everything from Eddie--his family, his friends, and his country. But they did not break his spirit. Against unbelievable odds, Eddie found the will to survive. Overwhelming grateful, he made a promise: he would smile every day in thanks for the precious gift he was given and to honor the six million Jews murdered by Hitler. Today, at 100 years of age, despite all he suffered, Eddie calls himself the \"happiest man on earth.\" In his remarkable memoir, this born storyteller shares his wisdom and reflects on how he has led his best possible life, talking warmly and openly about the power of gratitude, tolerance, and kindness. Life can be beautiful if you make it beautiful. With The Happiest Man on Earth, Eddie shows us how.

Profanity has always been a deliciously vibrant part of our lexicon, an integral part of being human. In fact, our ability to curse comes from a different part of the brain than other parts of speech--the urgency with which we say \"f&*k!\" is instead related to the instinct that tells us to flee from danger. Language evolves with time, and so does what we consider profane or unspeakable.

In this, her first book, now available in paperback, Simard brings us into her world, the intimate world of the trees, in which she brilliantly illuminates the fascinating and vital truths--that trees are not simply the source of timber or pulp, but are a complicated, interdependent circle of life; that forests are social, cooperative creatures connected through underground networks by which trees communicate their vitality and vulnerabilities with communal lives not that different from our own. Simard writes--in inspiring, illuminating, and accessible ways\u2014how trees, living side by side for hundreds of years, have evolved, how they learn and adapt their behaviors, recognize neighbors, compete and cooperate with one another with sophistication, characteristics ascribed to human intelligence, traits that are the essence of civil societies--and at the center of it all, the Mother Trees: the mysterious, powerful forces that connect and sustain the others that surround them. And Simard writes of her own life, born and raised into a logging world in the rainforests of British Columbia, of her days as a child spent cataloging the trees from the forest and how she came to love and respect them. And as she writes of her scientific quest, she writes of her own journey, making us understand how deeply human scientific inquiry exists beyond data and technology, that it is about understanding who we are and our place in the world."}, {"rank": 7, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1250799244", "primary_isbn13": "9781250799241", "publisher": "Metropolitan/Holt", "description": "The senior senator from Massachusetts shares six influential perspectives that shaped her life and advocacy.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Persist", "author": "Elizabeth Warren", "contributor": "by Elizabeth Warren", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781250799241.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250799244?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1250799244", "isbn13": "9781250799241"}, {"isbn10": "1250799252", "isbn13": "9781250799258"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250799244?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781250799241?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781250799241"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FPERSIST%2FElizabeth%2BWarren%2F9781250799241"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781250799241"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250799241?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/71c7da67-1728-57a3-b896-927161010dd7", "list_date": "2021/05/23", "published_data": "2021-04-20", "summary": "TK"}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 105, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1524763144", "primary_isbn13": "9781524763145", "publisher": "Crown", "description": "The former first lady describes her journey from the South Side of Chicago to the White House, and how she balanced work, family and her husband\u2019s political ascent.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Becoming", "author": "Michelle Obama", "contributor": "by Michelle Obama", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781524763138.jpg", "book_image_width": 326, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Michelle-Obama/dp/1524763136?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/books/review/michelle-obama-becoming-memoir.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1524763136", "isbn13": "9781524763138"}, {"isbn10": "0525633677", "isbn13": "9780525633679"}, {"isbn10": "1524763144", "isbn13": "9781524763145"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Michelle-Obama/dp/1524763136?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781524763145?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781524763145"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FBECOMING%2FMichelle%2BObama%2F9781524763145"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781524763145"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781524763145?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/8cf1d8dc-669e-5662-8c67-36cebeaf2aef", "list_date": "2021/05/23", "published_data": "2021-03-02", "summary": "Now in paperback\u2014the intimate, powerful, and inspiring memoir by the former First Lady of the United States, featuring a new introduction by Michelle Obama, a letter from the author to her younger self, and a book club guide with 20 discussion questions and a 5-question Q&A #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 WATCH THE EMMY-NOMINATED NETFLIX ORIGINAL DOCUMENTARY \u2022 OPRAH\u2019S BOOK CLUB PICK \u2022 NAACP IMAGE AWARD WINNER \u2022 ONE OF ESSENCE\u2019S 50 MOST IMPACTFUL BLACK BOOKS OF THE PAST 50 YEARS In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era.

But what gets lost in the debates about policy are the stories of immigrants themselves, the people who are drawn to America by its promise of economic opportunity and political and religious freedom\u2014and who strengthen our nation in countless ways. In the tradition of Portraits of Courage, President Bush\u2019s #1 New York Times bestseller, Out of Many, One brings together forty-three full-color portraits of men and women who have immigrated to the United States, alongside stirring stories of the unique ways all of them are pursuing the American Dream. Featuring men and women from thirty-five countries and nearly every region of the world, Out of Many, One shows how hard work, strong values, dreams, and determination know no borders or boundaries and how immigrants embody values that are often viewed as distinctly American: optimism and gratitude, a willingness to strive and to risk, a deep sense of patriotism, and a spirit of self-reliance that runs deep in our immigrant heritage. In these pages, we meet a North Korean refugee fighting for human rights, a Dallas-based CEO who crossed the Rio Grande from Mexico at age seventeen, and a NASA engineer who as a girl in Nigeria dreamed of coming to America, along with notable figures from business, the military, sports, and entertainment. President Bush captures their faces and stories in striking detail, bringing depth to our understanding of who immigrants are, the challenges they face on their paths to citizenship, and the lessons they can teach us about our country\u2019s character. As the stories unfold in this vibrant book, readers will gain a better appreciation for the humanity behind one of our most pressing policy issues and the countless ways in which America, through its tradition of welcoming newcomers, has been strengthened by those who have come here in search of a better life."}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 6, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0393356310", "primary_isbn13": "9780393356311", "publisher": "Norton", "description": " A look at an expanding low-cost labor pool, which largely consists of transient older adults, and what this might portend.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Nomadland", "author": "Jessica Bruder", "contributor": "by Jessica Bruder", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780393356311.jpg", "book_image_width": 333, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0393356310?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/books/review/nomadland-jessica-bruder.html", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0393356310", "isbn13": "9780393356311"}, {"isbn10": "0393249328", "isbn13": "9780393249323"}, {"isbn10": "039324931X", "isbn13": "9780393249316"}, {"isbn10": "1432846434", "isbn13": "9781432846435"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0393356310?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780393356311?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780393356311"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FNOMADLAND%2FJessica%2BBruder%2F9780393356311"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780393356311"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780393356311?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/8a90ea18-778d-56ab-af1c-45457f314cf1", "list_date": "2021/05/16", "published_data": "2018-09-04", "summary": "The inspiration for Chlo\u00e9 Zhao's 2020 Golden Globe award-winning film starring Frances McDormand. \"People who thought the 2008 financial collapse was over a long time ago need to meet the people Jessica Bruder got to know in this scorching, beautifully written, vivid, disturbing (and occasionally wryly funny) book.\" \u2014Rebecca Solnit From the beet fields of North Dakota to the campgrounds of California to Amazon\u2019s CamperForce program in Texas, employers have discovered a new, low-cost labor pool, made up largely of transient older adults.

This fascinating history of the antitrust movement shows us what led to the present moment and offers achievable solutions to prevent monopolies, promote business competition, and encourage innovation. In a world where Google reportedly controls 90 percent of the search engine market and Big Pharma\u2019s drug price hikes impact healthcare accessibility, monopolies can hurt consumers and cause marketplace stagnation. Klobuchar\u2014the much-admired former candidate for president of the United States\u2014argues for swift, sweeping reform in economic, legislative, social welfare, and human rights policies, and describes plans, ideas, and legislative proposals designed to strengthen antitrust laws and antitrust enforcement. Klobuchar writes of the historic and current fights against monopolies in America, from Standard Oil and the Sherman Anti-Trust Act to the Progressive Era's trust-busters; from the breakup of Ma Bell (formerly the world's biggest company and largest private telephone system) to the pricing monopoly of Big Pharma and the future of the giant tech companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google. She begins with the Gilded Age (1870s-1900), when builders of fortunes and rapacious robber barons such as J. P. Morgan, John Rockefeller, and Cornelius Vanderbilt were reaping vast fortunes as industrialization swept across the American landscape, with the rich getting vastly richer and the poor, poorer. She discusses President Theodore Roosevelt, who, during the Progressive Era (1890s-1920), \"busted\" the trusts, breaking up monopolies; the Clayton Act of 1914; the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914; and the Celler-Kefauver Act of 1950, which it strengthened the Clayton Act. She explores today's Big Pharma and its price-gouging; and tech, television, content, and agriculture communities and how a marketplace with few players, or one in which one company dominates distribution, can hurt consumer prices and stifle innovation. As the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, Klobuchar provides a fascinating exploration of antitrust in America and offers a way forward to protect all Americans from the dangers of curtailed competition, and from vast information gathering, through monopolies."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 13, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0385545681", "primary_isbn13": "9780385545686", "publisher": "Doubleday", "description": "A portrait of the Sackler family, known for their philanthropy toward institutions around the world, and their involvement with Valium and OxyContin.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Empire Of Pain", "author": "Patrick Radden Keefe", "contributor": "by Patrick Radden Keefe", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780385545686.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385545681?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0385545681", "isbn13": "9780385545686"}, {"isbn10": "038554569X", "isbn13": "9780385545693"}, {"isbn10": "0593416287", "isbn13": "9780593416280"}, {"isbn10": "1984899015", "isbn13": "9781984899019"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385545681?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780385545686?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780385545686"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FEMPIRE%2BOF%2BPAIN%2FPatrick%2BRadden%2BKeefe%2F9780385545686"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780385545686"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780385545686?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/64fe7298-a088-5a32-b100-f9271479c6c5", "list_date": "2021/05/16", "published_data": "2021-04-13", "summary": "NATIONAL BOOK CRITICS CIRCLE NOMINEE \u2022 A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK OF THE YEAR \u2022 NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLER \u2022 A grand, devastating portrait of three generations of the Sackler family, famed for their philanthropy, whose fortune was built by Valium and whose reputation was destroyed by OxyContin. From the prize-winning and bestselling author of Say Nothing The history of the Sackler dynasty is rife with drama\u2014baroque personal lives; bitter disputes over estates; fistfights in boardrooms; glittering art collections; Machiavellian courtroom maneuvers; and the calculated use of money to burnish reputations and crush the less powerful. The Sackler name has adorned the walls of many storied institutions\u2014Harvard, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oxford, the Louvre. They are one of the richest families in the world, known for their lavish donations to the arts and the sciences. The source of the family fortune was vague, however, until it emerged that the Sacklers were responsible for making and marketing a blockbuster painkiller that was the catalyst for the opioid crisis. Empire of Pain begins with the story of three doctor brothers, Raymond, Mortimer and the incalculably energetic Arthur, who weathered the poverty of the Great Depression and appalling anti-Semitism. Working at a barbaric mental institution, Arthur saw a better way and conducted groundbreaking research into drug treatments. He also had a genius for marketing, especially for pharmaceuticals, and bought a small ad firm. Arthur devised the marketing for Valium, and built the first great Sackler fortune. He purchased a drug manufacturer, Purdue Frederick, which would be run by Raymond and Mortimer. The brothers began collecting art, and wives, and grand residences in exotic locales. Their children and grandchildren grew up in luxury. Forty years later, Raymond\u2019s son Richard ran the family-owned Purdue. The template Arthur Sackler created to sell Valium\u2014co-opting doctors, influencing the FDA, downplaying the drug\u2019s addictiveness\u2014was employed to launch a far more potent product: OxyContin. The drug went on to generate some thirty-five billion dollars in revenue, and to launch a public health crisis in which hundreds of thousands would die. This is the saga of three generations of a single family and the mark they would leave on the world, a tale that moves from the bustling streets of early twentieth-century Brooklyn to the seaside palaces of Greenwich, Connecticut, and Cap d\u2019Antibes to the corridors of power in Washington, D.C. Empire of Pain chronicles the multiple investigations of the Sacklers and their company, and the scorched-earth legal tactics that the family has used to evade accountability. Empire of Pain is a masterpiece of narrative reporting and writing, exhaustively documented and ferociously compelling. It is a portrait of the excesses of America\u2019s second Gilded Age, a study of impunity among the super elite and a relentless investigation of the naked greed and indifference to human suffering that built one of the world\u2019s great fortunes."}, {"rank": 4, "rank_last_week": 1, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1250238447", "primary_isbn13": "9781250238443", "publisher": "St. Martin's", "description": "The former speaker of the House reflects on his time in Washington, key political figures and the current state of the Republican Party.", "price": "0.00", "title": "On The House", "author": "John Boehner", "contributor": "by John Boehner", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781250238443.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250238447?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1250238447", "isbn13": "9781250238443"}, {"isbn10": "1250277183", "isbn13": "9781250277183"}, {"isbn10": "1250752302", "isbn13": "9781250752307"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250238447?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781250238443?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781250238443"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FON%2BTHE%2BHOUSE%2FJohn%2BBoehner%2F9781250238443"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781250238443"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250238443?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/d6ee4690-a99e-5329-9f29-66bb34a482ff", "list_date": "2021/05/09", "published_data": "2021-04-13", "summary": "* INSTANT #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER * #1 WALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLER * \u201cA rollicking, foil-mouthed\u201d [memoir]....Boehner has delivered a classic Washington \u201ctell-all,\u201d albeit one with his typical jocular style.\u201d --The Washington Post Former Speaker of the House John Boehner shares colorful tales from the halls of power, the smoke-filled rooms around the halls of power, and his fabled tour bus. John Boehner is the last of a breed. At a time when the arbiters of American culture were obsessing over organic kale, cold-pressed juice, and SoulCycle, the man who stood second in line to the presidency was unapologetically smoking Camels, quaffing a glass of red, and hitting the golf course whenever he could. There could hardly have been a more diametrically opposed figure to represent the opposition party in President Barack Obama's Washington. But when Boehner announced his resignation, President Obama called to tell the outgoing Speaker that he'd miss him. \"Mr. President,\" Boehner replied, \"yes you will.\" He thought of himself as a \"regular guy with a big job,\" and he enjoyed it. In addition to his own stories of life in the swamp city and of his comeback after getting knocked off the leadership ladder, Boehner offers his impressions of leaders he's met and what made them successes or failures, from Ford and Reagan to Obama, Trump, and Biden. He shares his views on how the Republican Party has become unrecognizable today; the advice--some harsh, some fatherly--he dished out to members of his own party, the opposition, the media, and others; and his often acid-tongued comments about his former colleagues. And of course he talks about golfing with five presidents. Through Speaker Boehner's honest and self-aware reflections, you'll be reminded of a time when the adults were firmly in charge."}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1250247136", "primary_isbn13": "9781250247131", "publisher": "St. Martin's", "description": "A depiction of the frontiersman Daniel Boone.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Blood And Treasure", "author": "Bob Drury and Tom Clavin", "contributor": "by Bob Drury and Tom Clavin", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781250247131.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250247136?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1250247136", "isbn13": "9781250247131"}, {"isbn10": "1250247152", "isbn13": "9781250247155"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250247136?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781250247131?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781250247131"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FBLOOD%2BAND%2BTREASURE%2FBob%2BDrury%2Band%2BTom%2BClavin%2F9781250247131"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781250247131"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250247131?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/be757de6-f391-5ccb-8c47-7c90658c3c13", "list_date": "2021/05/09", "published_data": "2021-04-20", "summary": "N/A"}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 4, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593237242", "primary_isbn13": "9780593237243", "publisher": "Crown", "description": "The six-time Grammy Award-winning singer and songwriter recounts difficulties during her formative years and her hard-won successes.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Broken Horses", "author": "Brandi Carlile", "contributor": "by Brandi Carlile", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593237243.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593237242?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593237242", "isbn13": "9780593237243"}, {"isbn10": "0593237250", "isbn13": "9780593237250"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593237242?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593237243?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593237243"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FBROKEN%2BHORSES%2FBrandi%2BCarlile%2F9780593237243"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593237243"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593237243?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/996cc647-b128-5462-b373-959c7426cde2", "list_date": "2021/05/09", "published_data": "2021-04-06", "summary": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 The critically acclaimed singer-songwriter, producer, and six-time Grammy winner opens up about faith, sexuality, parenthood, and a life shaped by music in \u201cone of the great memoirs of our time\u201d (Glennon Doyle, author of Untamed). NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR AND AUTOSTRADDLE \u2022 \u201cThe best-written, most engaging rock autobiography since her childhood hero, Elton John, published Me.\u201d\u2014Variety Brandi Carlile was born into a musically gifted, impoverished family on the outskirts of Seattle and grew up in a constant state of change, moving from house to house, trailer to trailer, fourteen times in as many years. Though imperfect in every way, her dysfunctional childhood was as beautiful as it was strange, and as nurturing as it was difficult. At the age of five, Brandi contracted bacterial meningitis, which almost took her life, leaving an indelible mark on her formative years and altering her journey into young adulthood. As an openly gay teenager, Brandi grappled with the tension between her sexuality and her faith when her pastor publicly refused to baptize her on the day of the ceremony. Shockingly, her small town rallied around Brandi in support and set her on a path to salvation where the rest of the misfits and rejects find it: through twisted, joyful, weird, and wonderful music. In Broken Horses, Brandi Carlile takes readers through the events of her life that shaped her very raw art\u2014from her start at a local singing competition where she performed Elton John\u2019s \u201cHonky Cat\u201d in a bedazzled white polyester suit, to her first break opening for Dave Matthews Band, to many sleepless tours over fifteen years and six studio albums, all while raising two children with her wife, Catherine Shepherd. This hard-won success led her to collaborations with personal heroes like Elton John, Dolly Parton, Mavis Staples, Pearl Jam, Tanya Tucker, and Joni Mitchell, as well as her peers in the supergroup The Highwomen, and ultimately to the Grammy stage, where she converted millions of viewers into instant fans. Evocative and piercingly honest, Broken Horses is at once an examination of faith through the eyes of a person rejected by the church\u2019s basic tenets and a meditation on the moments and lyrics that have shaped the life of a creative mind, a brilliant artist, and a genuine empath on a mission to give back."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1538750694", "primary_isbn13": "9781538750698", "publisher": "Twelve", "description": "Based on numerous interviews, the USA Today Washington bureau chief profiles the current speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Madam Speaker", "author": "Susan Page", "contributor": "by Susan Page", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781538750698.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1538750694?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1538750694", "isbn13": "9781538750698"}, {"isbn10": "1538750716", "isbn13": "9781538750711"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1538750694?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781538750698?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781538750698"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FMADAM%2BSPEAKER%2FSusan%2BPage%2F9781538750698"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781538750698"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781538750698?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/41e3665c-c7d7-56f7-8f7a-4ea30643710e", "list_date": "2021/05/09", "published_data": "2021-04-06", "summary": "The definitive biography of Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful woman in American political history, written by New York Times bestselling author and USA TODAY Washington Bureau Chief Susan Page."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 8, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1250077036", "primary_isbn13": "9781250077035", "publisher": "Holt", "description": "The humorist maps out her mental and physical health journey.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Broken", "author": "Jenny Lawson", "contributor": "by Jenny Lawson", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781250077035.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250077036?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1250077036", "isbn13": "9781250077035"}, {"isbn10": "1250077052", "isbn13": "9781250077059"}, {"isbn10": "1250790948", "isbn13": "9781250790941"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250077036?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781250077035?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781250077035"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FBROKEN%2FJenny%2BLawson%2F9781250077035"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781250077035"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250077035?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/addc4806-205a-59d7-8aef-f56eef3b745e", "list_date": "2021/05/09", "published_data": "2021-04-06", "summary": "From #1 New York Times bestselling author Jenny Lawson comes her most personal book yet.

She tackles such timelessly debated questions as \u201cHow do dogs know they have penises?\u201d We see how her vacuum cleaner almost set her house on fire, how she was attacked by three bears, business ideas she wants to pitch to Shark Tank, and why she can never go back to the post office.

This singular memoir\u2014a classic American story\u2014invites readers to Erin's corner of her beloved Maine to share the real person behind the \u201cgirl from Freedom\u201d fairytale, and the not-so-picture-perfect struggles that have taken every ounce of her strength to overcome, and that make Erin\u2019s life triumphant. In Finding Freedom, Erin opens up to the challenges, stumbles, and victories that have led her to the exact place she was ever meant to be, telling stories of multiple rock-bottoms, of darkness and anxiety, of survival as a jobless single mother, of pills that promised release but delivered addiction, of a man who seemed to offer salvation but in the end ripped away her very sense of self. And of the beautiful son who was her guiding light as she slowly rebuilt her personal and culinary life around the solace she found in food\u2014as a source of comfort, a sense of place, as a way of bringing goodness into the world.

Since then, physicists have been placing new forces into ever-grander theories. But perhaps the ultimate challenge is achieving a monumental synthesis of the two remaining theories\u2014relativity and the quantum theory. This would be the crowning achievement of science, a profound merging of all the forces of nature into one beautiful, magnificent equation to unlock the deepest mysteries in science: What happened before the Big Bang? What lies on the other side of a black hole? Are there other universes and dimensions? Is time travel possible? Why are we here? Kaku also explains the intense controversy swirling around this theory, with Nobel laureates taking opposite sides on this vital question. It is a captivating, gripping story; what\u2019s at stake is nothing less than our conception of the universe.

Witnesses to the brutal murder of their families and neighbors and the violent destruction of their communities, a cadre of Jewish women in Poland--some still in their teens--helped transform the Jewish youth groups into resistance cells to fight the Nazis. With courage, guile, and nerves of steel, these \"ghetto girls\" paid off Gestapo guards, hid revolvers in loaves of bread and jars of marmalade, and helped build systems of underground bunkers. They flirted with German soldiers, bribed them with wine, whiskey, and home cooking, used their Aryan looks to seduce them, and shot and killed them. They bombed German train lines and blew up a town's water supply. They also nursed the sick and taught children. Yet the exploits of these courageous resistance fighters have remained virtually unknown. As propulsive and thrilling as Hidden Figures, In the Garden of Beasts, Band of Brothers, and A Train in Winter, The Light of Days at last tells the true story of these incredible women whose courageous yet little-known feats have been eclipsed by time. Judy Batalion--the granddaughter of Polish Holocaust survivors--takes us back to 1939 and introduces us to Renia Kukielka, a weapons smuggler and messenger who risked death traveling across occupied Poland on foot and by train. Joining Renia are other women who served as couriers, armed fighters, intelligence agents, and saboteurs, all who put their lives in mortal danger to carry out their missions. Batalion follows these women through the savage destruction of the ghettos, arrest and internment in Gestapo prisons and concentration camps, and for a lucky few--like Renia, who orchestrated her own audacious escape from a brutal Nazi jail--into the late 20th century and beyond. Powerful and inspiring, featuring twenty black-and-white photographs, The Light of Days is an unforgettable true tale of war, the fight for freedom, exceptional bravery, female friendship, and survival in the face of staggering odds."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 14, "weeks_on_list": 4, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0316257575", "primary_isbn13": "9780316257572", "publisher": "Little, Brown", "description": "The CNN host looks at the impact of racism on his life and prescribes ways to address systemic flaws in America.", "price": "0.00", "title": "This Is The Fire", "author": "Don Lemon", "contributor": "by Don Lemon", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780316257572.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316257575?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0316257575", "isbn13": "9780316257572"}, {"isbn10": "031627352X", "isbn13": "9780316273527"}, {"isbn10": "031625777X", "isbn13": "9780316257770"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316257575?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780316257572?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780316257572"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHIS%2BIS%2BTHE%2BFIRE%2FDon%2BLemon%2F9780316257572"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780316257572"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780316257572?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/3ca9d4e3-9aeb-5d0b-a6d7-5bbb0aa9b7ef", "list_date": "2021/04/25", "published_data": "2021-03-16", "summary": "\"The host of CNN Tonight with Don Lemon is more popular than ever.

influential thinkers offers a powerful exploration of inequality and the lesson that generations of Americans have failed to learn: Racism has a cost for everyone\u2014not just for people of color. WINNER OF THE PORCHLIGHT BUSINESS BOOK AWARD \u2022 ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: Time, The Washington Post, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Ms. magazine, BookRiot, Library Journal \u201cThis is the book I\u2019ve been waiting for.\u201d\u2014Ibram X. Kendi, #1 New York Times bestselling author of How to Be an Antiracist Look for the author\u2019s new podcast, The Sum of Us, based on this book! Heather McGhee\u2019s specialty is the American economy\u2014and the mystery of why it so often fails the American public. From the financial crisis of 2008 to rising student debt to collapsing public infrastructure, she found a root problem: racism in our politics and policymaking. But not just in the most obvious indignities for people of color. Racism has costs for white people, too. It is the common denominator of our most vexing public problems, the core dysfunction of our democracy and constitutive of the spiritual and moral crises that grip us all. But how did this happen? And is there a way out? McGhee embarks on a deeply personal journey across the country from Maine to Mississippi to California, tallying what we lose when we buy into the zero-sum paradigm\u2014the idea that progress for some of us must come at the expense of others. Along the way, she meets white people who confide in her about losing their homes, their dreams, and their shot at better jobs to the toxic mix of American racism and greed. This is the story of how public goods in this country\u2014from parks and pools to functioning schools\u2014have become private luxuries; of how unions collapsed, wages stagnated, and inequality increased; and of how this country, unique among the world\u2019s advanced economies, has thwarted universal healthcare. But in unlikely places of worship and work, McGhee finds proof of what she calls the Solidarity Dividend: the benefits we gain when people come together across race to accomplish what we simply can\u2019t do on our own. The Sum of Us is not only a brilliant analysis of how we arrived here but also a heartfelt message, delivered with startling empathy, from a black woman to a multiracial America. It leaves us with a new vision for a future in which we finally realize that life can be more than a zero-sum game.

Bill Gates has spent a decade investigating the causes and effects of climate change. With the help of experts in the fields of physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, political science, and finance, he has focused on what must be done in order to stop the planet's slide to certain environmental disaster. In this book, he not only explains why we need to work toward net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases, but also details what we need to do to achieve this profoundly important goal. He gives us a clear-eyed description of the challenges we face. Drawing on his understanding of innovation and what it takes to get new ideas into the market, he describes the areas in which technology is already helping to reduce emissions, where and how the current technology can be made to function more effectively, where breakthrough technologies are needed, and who is working on these essential innovations. Finally, he lays out a concrete, practical plan for achieving the goal of zero emissions\u2014suggesting not only policies that governments should adopt, but what we as individuals can do to keep our government, our employers, and ourselves accountable in this crucial enterprise. As Bill Gates makes clear, achieving zero emissions will not be simple or easy to do, but if we follow the plan he sets out here, it is a goal firmly within our reach."}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 8, "weeks_on_list": 20, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1524763160", "primary_isbn13": "9781524763169", "publisher": "Crown", "description": "In the first volume of his presidential memoirs, Barack Obama offers personal reflections on his formative years and pivotal moments through his first term.", "price": "0.00", "title": "A Promised Land", "author": "Barack Obama", "contributor": "by Barack Obama", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781524763169.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1524763160?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1524763160", "isbn13": "9781524763169"}, {"isbn10": "1524763187", "isbn13": "9781524763183"}, {"isbn10": "0525633715", "isbn13": "9780525633716"}, {"isbn10": "0593239040", "isbn13": "9780593239049"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1524763160?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781524763169?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781524763169"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FA%2BPROMISED%2BLAND%2FBarack%2BObama%2F9781524763169"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781524763169"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781524763169?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/945a5dfb-d1e6-53f2-95e2-ed6ffe3c5052", "list_date": "2021/04/18", "published_data": "2020-11-17", "summary": "A riveting, deeply personal account of history in the making\u2014from the president who inspired us to believe in the power of democracy #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 NAACP IMAGE AWARD NOMINEE \u2022 NAMED ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY The Washington Post \u2022 Jennifer Szalai, The New York Times \u2022 NPR \u2022 The Guardian \u2022 Marie Claire In the stirring, highly anticipated first volume of his presidential memoirs, Barack Obama tells the story of his improbable odyssey from young man searching for his identity to leader of the free world, describing in strikingly personal detail both his political education and the landmark moments of the first term of his historic presidency\u2014a time of dramatic transformation and turmoil. Obama takes readers on a compelling journey from his earliest political aspirations to the pivotal Iowa caucus victory that demonstrated the power of grassroots activism to the watershed night of November 4, 2008, when he was elected 44th president of the United States, becoming the first African American to hold the nation\u2019s highest office. Reflecting on the presidency, he offers a unique and thoughtful exploration of both the awesome reach and the limits of presidential power, as well as singular insights into the dynamics of U.S. partisan politics and international diplomacy. Obama brings readers inside the Oval Office and the White House Situation Room, and to Moscow, Cairo, Beijing, and points beyond. We are privy to his thoughts as he assembles his cabinet, wrestles with a global financial crisis, takes the measure of Vladimir Putin, overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds to secure passage of the Affordable Care Act, clashes with generals about U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, tackles Wall Street reform, responds to the devastating Deepwater Horizon blowout, and authorizes Operation Neptune\u2019s Spear, which leads to the death of Osama bin Laden. A Promised Land is extraordinarily intimate and introspective\u2014the story of one man\u2019s bet with history, the faith of a community organizer tested on the world stage. Obama is candid about the balancing act of running for office as a Black American, bearing the expectations of a generation buoyed by messages of \u201chope and change,\u201d and meeting the moral challenges of high-stakes decision-making. He is frank about the forces that opposed him at home and abroad, open about how living in the White House affected his wife and daughters, and unafraid to reveal self-doubt and disappointment. Yet he never wavers from his belief that inside the great, ongoing American experiment, progress is always possible. This beautifully written and powerful book captures Barack Obama\u2019s conviction that democracy is not a gift from on high but something founded on empathy and common understanding and built together, day by day."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "006289921X", "primary_isbn13": "9780062899217", "publisher": "Harper", "description": "How popular culture was impacted by what happened in Los Angeles in 1974 in movies, music, television and politics.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Rock Me On The Water", "author": "Ronald Brownstein", "contributor": "by Ronald Brownstein", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780062899217.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/006289921X?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "006289921X", "isbn13": "9780062899217"}, {"isbn10": "0062899236", "isbn13": "9780062899231"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/006289921X?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780062899217?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780062899217"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FROCK%2BME%2BON%2BTHE%2BWATER%2FRonald%2BBrownstein%2F9780062899217"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780062899217"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062899217?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/8b7aeaf9-81e7-5ba1-b015-13f1d32789b9", "list_date": "2021/04/18", "published_data": "2021-03-23", "summary": "In this exceptional cultural history, Atlantic Senior Editor Ronald Brownstein--\"one of America's best political journalists (The Economist)--tells the kaleidoscopic story of one monumental year that marked the city of Los Angeles' creative peak, a glittering moment when popular culture was ahead of politics in predicting what America would become. Los Angeles in 1974 exerted more influence over popular culture than any other city in America. Los Angeles that year, in fact, dominated popular culture more than it ever had before, or would again. Working in film, recording, and television studios around Sunset Boulevard, living in Brentwood and Beverly Hills or amid the flickering lights of the Hollywood Hills, a cluster of transformative talents produced an explosion in popular culture which reflected the demographic, social, and cultural realities of a changing America. At a time when Richard Nixon won two presidential elections with a message of backlash against the social changes unleashed by the sixties, popular culture was ahead of politics in predicting what America would become. The early 1970s in Los Angeles was the time and the place where conservatives definitively lost the battle to control popular culture. Rock Me on the Water traces the confluence of movies, music, television, and politics in Los Angeles month by month through that transformative, magical year. Ronald Brownstein reveals how 1974 represented a confrontation between a massive younger generation intent on change, and a political order rooted in the status quo. Today, we are again witnessing a generational cultural divide. Brownstein shows how the voices resistant to change may win the political battle for a time, but they cannot hold back the future."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0812997298", "primary_isbn13": "9780812997293", "publisher": "Random House", "description": "A Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning investigative reporter formerly with The New York Times looks at ways food can be addictive.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Hooked", "author": "Michael Moss", "contributor": "by Michael Moss", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780812997293.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0812997298?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0812997298", "isbn13": "9780812997293"}, {"isbn10": "0812997301", "isbn13": "9780812997309"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0812997298?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780812997293?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780812997293"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FHOOKED%2FMichael%2BMoss%2F9780812997293"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780812997293"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780812997293?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/638eec2b-fcac-588d-ba42-ada0b110c81e", "list_date": "2021/04/18", "published_data": "2021-03-02", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 From the author of Salt Sugar Fat comes a \u201cgripping\u201d (The Wall Street Journal) expos\u00e9 of how the processed food industry exploits our evolutionary instincts, the emotions we associate with food, and legal loopholes in their pursuit of profit over public health. \u201cThe processed food industry has managed to avoid being lumped in with Big Tobacco\u2014which is why Michael Moss\u2019s new book is so important.\u201d\u2014Charles Duhigg, author of The Power of Habit Everyone knows how hard it can be to maintain a healthy diet. But what if some of the decisions we make about what to eat are beyond our control? Is it possible that food is addictive, like drugs or alcohol? And to what extent does the food industry know, or care, about these vulnerabilities? In Hooked, Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning investigative reporter Michael Moss sets out to answer these questions\u2014and to find the true peril in our food. Moss uses the latest research on addiction to uncover what the scientific and medical communities\u2014as well as food manufacturers\u2014already know: that food, in some cases, is even more addictive than alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs. Our bodies are hardwired for sweets, so food giants have developed fifty-six types of sugar to add to their products, creating in us the expectation that everything should be cloying; we\u2019ve evolved to prefer fast, convenient meals, hence our modern-day preference for ready-to-eat foods. Moss goes on to show how the processed food industry\u2014including major companies like Nestl\u00e9, Mars, and Kellogg\u2019s\u2014has tried not only to evade this troubling discovery about the addictiveness of food but to actually exploit it. For instance, in response to recent dieting trends, food manufacturers have simply turned junk food into junk diets, filling grocery stores with \u201cdiet\u201d foods that are hardly distinguishable from the products that got us into trouble in the first place. As obesity rates continue to climb, manufacturers are now claiming to add ingredients that can effortlessly cure our compulsive eating habits. A gripping account of the legal battles, insidious marketing campaigns, and cutting-edge food science that have brought us to our current public health crisis, Hooked lays out all that the food industry is doing to exploit and deepen our addictions, and shows us why what we eat has never mattered more."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1538718502", "primary_isbn13": "9781538718506", "publisher": "Twelve", "description": "A memoir by the biracial daughter of an American father and a Thai-Chinese mother who served in the Iraq War and is currently a senator from Illinois.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Every Day Is A Gift", "author": "Tammy Duckworth", "contributor": "by Tammy Duckworth", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781538718506.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1538718502?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1538718502", "isbn13": "9781538718506"}, {"isbn10": "1538718499", "isbn13": "9781538718490"}, {"isbn10": "153872121X", "isbn13": "9781538721216"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1538718502?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781538718506?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781538718506"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FEVERY%2BDAY%2BIS%2BA%2BGIFT%2FTammy%2BDuckworth%2F9781538718506"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781538718506"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781538718506?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/955ea6cc-a3b5-553d-a067-2e77c3a531a1", "list_date": "2021/04/18", "published_data": "2021-03-30", "summary": "The incredible story of U.S. senator and Iraq War veteran Tammy Duckworth. In EVERY DAY IS A GIFT, Tammy Duckworth takes readers through the amazing--and amazingly true--stories from her incomparable life. In November of 2004, an Iraqi RPG blew through the cockpit of Tammy Duckworth's U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter. The explosion, which destroyed her legs and mangled her right arm, was a turning point in her life. But as Duckworth shows in EVERY DAY IS A GIFT, that moment was just one in a lifetime of extraordinary turns. The biracial daughter of an American father and a Thai-Chinese mother, Duckworth faced discrimination, poverty, and the horrors of war -- all before the age of 16. As a child, she dodged bullets as her family fled war-torn Phnom Penh. As a teenager, she sold roses by the side of the road to save her family from hunger and homelessness in Hawaii. Through these experiences, she developed a fierce resilience that would prove invaluable in the years to come. Duckworth joined the Army, becoming one of a handful of female helicopter pilots at the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom. She served eight months in Iraq before an insurgent's RPG shot down her helicopter, an attack that took her legs -- and nearly took her life. She then spent thirteen months recovering at Walter Reed, learning to walk again on prosthetic legs and planning her return to the cockpit.

If you're over forty, you're probably not laughing. You might even be worried that these lapses in memory could be an early sign of Alzheimer's or dementia. In reality, for the vast majority of us, these examples of forgetting are completely normal. Why? Because while memory is amazing, it is far from perfect. Our brains aren't designed to remember every name we hear, plan we make, or day we experience. Just because your memory sometimes fails doesn't mean it's broken or succumbing to disease. Forgetting is actually part of being human. In Remember, neuroscientist and acclaimed novelist Lisa Genova delves into how memories are made and how we retrieve them. You'll learn whether forgotten memories are temporarily inaccessible or erased forever and why some memories are built to exist for only a few seconds (like a passcode) while others can last a lifetime (your wedding day). You'll come to appreciate the clear distinction between normal forgetting (where you parked your car) and forgetting due to Alzheimer's (that you own a car). And you'll see how memory is profoundly impacted by meaning, emotion, sleep, stress, and context. Once you understand the language of memory and how it functions, its incredible strengths and maddening weaknesses, its natural vulnerabilities and potential superpowers, you can both vastly improve your ability to remember and feel less rattled when you inevitably forget. You can set educated expectations for your memory, and in doing so, create a better relationship with it. You don't have to fear it anymore. And that can be life-changing."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 5, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1250800463", "primary_isbn13": "9781250800466", "publisher": "Flatiron", "description": "A look at some questions and concepts needed to address systemic racism.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Uncomfortable Conversations With A Black Man", "author": "Emmanuel Acho", "contributor": "by Emmanuel Acho", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781250800466.jpg", "book_image_width": 324, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250800463?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1250800463", "isbn13": "9781250800466"}, {"isbn10": "1250807433", "isbn13": "9781250807434"}, {"isbn10": "1432884883", "isbn13": "9781432884888"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250800463?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781250800466?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781250800466"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FUNCOMFORTABLE%2BCONVERSATIONS%2BWITH%2BA%2BBLACK%2BMAN%2FEmmanuel%2BAcho%2F9781250800466"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781250800466"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250800466?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/fa432bfe-01a6-5e6d-ab8c-c6bfca17272e", "list_date": "2021/04/04", "published_data": "2020-11-10", "summary": "N/A"}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 13, "weeks_on_list": 6, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0316429090", "primary_isbn13": "9780316429092", "publisher": "Little, Brown", "description": "A collection of interviews with troops who fought overseas.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Walk In My Combat Boots", "author": "James Patterson and Matt Eversmann with Chris Mooney", "contributor": "by James Patterson and Matt Eversmann with Chris Mooney", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780316429092.jpg", "book_image_width": 322, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316429090?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0316429090", "isbn13": "9780316429092"}, {"isbn10": "0316429112", "isbn13": "9780316429115"}, {"isbn10": "1538753146", "isbn13": "9781538753149"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316429090?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780316429092?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780316429092"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FWALK%2BIN%2BMY%2BCOMBAT%2BBOOTS%2FJames%2BPatterson%2Band%2BMatt%2BEversmann%2Bwith%2BChris%2BMooney%2F9780316429092"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780316429092"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780316429092?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/6584de9c-c465-5aa5-89eb-d33201cfb5d8", "list_date": "2021/04/04", "published_data": "2021-02-08", "summary": "Soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines speak in their own words about real life in today's armed forces.

What can we learn from them? \u201cHunt, Gather, Parent is full of smart ideas that I immediately wanted to force on my own kids.\u201d \u2014Pamela Druckerman, The New York Times Book Review When Dr. Michaeleen Doucleff becomes a mother, she examines the studies behind modern parenting guidance and finds the evidence frustratingly limited and the conclusions often ineffective. Curious to learn about more effective parenting approaches, she visits a Maya village in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. There she encounters moms and dads who parent in a totally different way than we do\u2014and raise extraordinarily kind, generous, and helpful children without yelling, nagging, or issuing timeouts. What else, Doucleff wonders, are Western parents missing out on? In Hunt, Gather, Parent, Doucleff sets out with her three-year-old daughter in tow to learn and practice parenting strategies from families in three of the world\u2019s most venerable communities: Maya families in Mexico, Inuit families above the Arctic Circle, and Hadzabe families in Tanzania. She sees that these cultures don\u2019t have the same problems with children that Western parents do. Most strikingly, parents build a relationship with young children that is vastly different from the one many Western parents develop\u2014it\u2019s built on cooperation instead of control, trust instead of fear, and personalized needs instead of standardized development milestones. Maya parents are masters at raising cooperative children. Without resorting to bribes, threats, or chore charts, Maya parents rear loyal helpers by including kids in household tasks from the time they can walk. Inuit parents have developed a remarkably effective approach for teaching children emotional intelligence. When kids cry, hit, or act out, Inuit parents respond with a calm, gentle demeanor that teaches children how to settle themselves down and think before acting. Hadzabe parents are world experts on raising confident, self-driven kids with a simple tool that protects children from stress and anxiety, so common now among American kids. Not only does Doucleff live with families and observe their techniques firsthand, she also applies them with her own daughter, with striking results. She learns to discipline without yelling. She talks to psychologists, neuroscientists, anthropologists, and sociologists and explains how these strategies can impact children\u2019s mental health and development. Filled with practical takeaways that parents can implement immediately, Hunt, Gather, Parent helps us rethink the ways we relate to our children, and reveals a universal parenting paradigm adapted for American families."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 12, "weeks_on_list": 5, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593134044", "primary_isbn13": "9780593134047", "publisher": "One World", "description": "A compendium featuring 90 writers covering 400 years of African-American history.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Four Hundred Souls", "author": "edited  Ibram X.

Four Hundred Souls is a unique one-volume \u201ccommunity\u201d history of African Americans. The editors, Ibram X. Kendi and Keisha N.

They approach history from various perspectives: through the eyes of towering historical icons or the untold stories of ordinary people; through places, laws, and objects. While themes of resistance and struggle, of hope and reinvention, course through the book, this collection of diverse pieces from ninety different minds, reflecting ninety different perspectives, fundamentally deconstructs the idea that Africans in America are a monolith\u2014instead it unlocks the startling range of experiences and ideas that have always existed within the community of Blackness.

I am so grateful that this story has been told.\u201d \u2014Elizabeth Gilbert, author of Big Magic and Eat, Pray, Love \u201cAbsolutely fascinating and brilliantly written, The Daughters of Kobani is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand both the nobility and the brutality of war. This is one of the most compelling stories in modern warfare.\u201d \u2014Admiral William H. McRaven, author of Make Your Bed In 2014, northeastern Syria might have been the last place you would expect to find a revolution centered on women's rights. But that year, an all-female militia faced off against ISIS in a little town few had ever heard of: Kobani. By then, the Islamic State had swept across vast swaths of the country, taking town after town and spreading terror as the civil war burned all around it. From that unlikely showdown in Kobani emerged a fighting force that would wage war against ISIS across northern Syria alongside the United States. In the process, these women would spread their own political vision, determined to make women's equality a reality by fighting\u2014house by house, street by street, city by city\u2014the men who bought and sold women. Based on years of on-the-ground reporting, The Daughters of Kobani is the unforgettable story of the women of the Kurdish militia that improbably became part of the world's best hope for stopping ISIS in Syria. Drawing from hundreds of hours of interviews, bestselling author Gayle Tzemach Lemmon introduces us to the women fighting on the front lines, determined to not only extinguish the terror of ISIS but also prove that women could lead in war and must enjoy equal rights come the peace. In helping to cement the territorial defeat of ISIS, whose savagery toward women astounded the world, these women played a central role in neutralizing the threat the group posed worldwide. In the process they earned the respect\u2014and significant military support\u2014of U.S. Special Operations Forces. Rigorously reported and powerfully told, The Daughters of Kobani shines a light on a group of women intent on not only defeating the Islamic State on the battlefield but also changing women's lives in their corner of the Middle East and beyond."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1984880330", "primary_isbn13": "9781984880338", "publisher": "Penguin Press", "description": "The companion book to the PBS series that provides a look at five centuries of the meaning and functions of the Black church in America.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Black Church", "author": "Henry Louis Gates, Jr", "contributor": "by Henry Louis Gates, Jr.", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781984880338.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1984880330?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1984880330", "isbn13": "9781984880338"}, {"isbn10": "1984880349", "isbn13": "9781984880345"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1984880330?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781984880338?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781984880338"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BBLACK%2BCHURCH%2FHenry%2BLouis%2BGates%252C%2BJr%2F9781984880338"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781984880338"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781984880338?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/d891bd16-3274-5fe3-8c6d-c157c339ad51", "list_date": "2021/03/07", "published_data": "2021-02-16", "summary": "The instant New York Times bestseller and companion book to the PBS series. \u201cAbsolutely brilliant . . . A necessary and moving work.\u201d \u2014Eddie S. Glaude, Jr., author of Begin Again \u201cEngaging. . . . In Gates\u2019s telling, the Black church shines bright even as the nation itself moves uncertainly through the gloaming, seeking justice on earth\u2014as it is in heaven.\u201d \u2014Jon Meacham, New York Times Book Review From the New York Times bestselling author of Stony the Road and one of our most important voices on the African American experience comes a powerful new history of the Black church as a foundation of Black life and a driving force in the larger freedom struggle in America. For the young Henry Louis Gates, Jr., growing up in a small, residentially segregated West Virginia town, the church was a center of gravity\u2014an intimate place where voices rose up in song and neighbors gathered to celebrate life's blessings and offer comfort amid its trials and tribulations. In this tender and expansive reckoning with the meaning of the Black Church in America, Gates takes us on a journey spanning more than five centuries, from the intersection of Christianity and the transatlantic slave trade to today\u2019s political landscape. At road\u2019s end, and after Gates\u2019s distinctive meditation on the churches of his childhood, we emerge with a new understanding of the importance of African American religion to the larger national narrative\u2014as a center of resistance to slavery and white supremacy, as a magnet for political mobilization, as an incubator of musical and oratorical talent that would transform the culture, and as a crucible for working through the Black community\u2019s most critical personal and social issues. In a country that has historically afforded its citizens from the African diaspora tragically few safe spaces, the Black Church has always been more than a sanctuary. This fact was never lost on white supremacists: from the earliest days of slavery, when enslaved people were allowed to worship at all, their meetinghouses were subject to surveillance and destruction. Long after slavery\u2019s formal eradication, church burnings and bombings by anti-Black racists continued, a hallmark of the violent effort to suppress the African American struggle for equality. The past often isn\u2019t even past\u2014Dylann Roof committed his slaughter in the Mother Emanuel AME Church 193 years after it was first burned down by white citizens of Charleston, South Carolina, following a thwarted slave rebellion. But as Gates brilliantly shows, the Black church has never been only one thing. Its story lies at the heart of the Black political struggle, and it has produced many of the Black community\u2019s most notable leaders. At the same time, some churches and denominations have eschewed political engagement and exemplified practices of exclusion and intolerance that have caused polarization and pain. Those tensions remain today, as a rising generation demands freedom and dignity for all within and beyond their communities, regardless of race, sex, or gender. Still, as a source of faith and refuge, spiritual sustenance and struggle against society\u2019s darkest forces, the Black Church has been central, as this enthralling history makes vividly clear."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1635576059", "primary_isbn13": "9781635576054", "publisher": "Bloomsbury", "description": "The New York Times cybersecurity reporter describes a malicious and undetectable software bug that is in the hands of hostile nations and mercenaries.", "price": "0.00", "title": "This Is How They Tell Me The World Ends", "author": "Nicole Perlroth", "contributor": "by Nicole Perlroth", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781635576054.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1635576059?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1635576059", "isbn13": "9781635576054"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1635576059?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781635576054?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781635576054"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHIS%2BIS%2BHOW%2BTHEY%2BTELL%2BME%2BTHE%2BWORLD%2BENDS%2FNicole%2BPerlroth%2F9781635576054"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781635576054"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781635576054?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/b87b76ba-27a6-5b70-b1e7-6f4904303e43", "list_date": "2021/02/28", "published_data": "2021-02-09", "summary": "THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER WINNER of the 2021 Financial Times & McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award \u201cPart John le Carr\u00e9 and more parts Michael Crichton . . . spellbinding.\u201d The New Yorker \"Written in the hot, propulsive prose of a spy thriller\" (The New York Times), the untold story of the cyberweapons market\u2014the most secretive, government-backed market on earth\u2014and a terrifying first look at a new kind of global warfare.

There are true fairy tales. Stories that exist because impossible-to-explain coincidences change everything. Except in real life, not all of them have conventional, happily-ever-after endings. When Harry Met Minnie is that kind of fairy tale, with the vibrant, romantic New York City backdrop of its namesake, the movie When Harry Met Sally, and the bittersweet wisdom of Tuesdays with Morrie. There\u2019s a special camaraderie among early-morning dog walkers. Gathering at dog runs in the park, or strolling through Union Square Farmer\u2019s Market before the bustling crowd appears, fellow pet owners become familiar\u2013as do the personalities of their beloved animals. In this special space and time, a chance encounter with an old acquaintance changed Martha Teichner\u2019s world. As fate would have it, her friend knew someone who was dying of cancer, from radiation exposure after 9/11, and desperate to find a home for her dog, Harry. He was a Bull Terrier\u2014the same breed as Martha\u2019s dear Minnie. Would Martha consider giving Harry a safe, loving new home? In short order, boy dog meets girl dog, the fairy tale part of this story. But there is so much more to this book. After Martha agrees to meet Harry and his owner Carol, what begins as a transaction involving a dog becomes a deep and meaningful friendship between two women with complicated lives and a love of Bull Terriers in common. Through the heartbreak and grief of Carol\u2019s illness, the bond that develops changed Martha\u2019s life, Carol\u2019s life, Minnie\u2019s life, Harry\u2019s life. As it changed Carol\u2019s death as well. In this rich and touching narrative, Martha considers the ways our stories are shaped by the people we meet, and the profound love we can find by opening our hearts to unexpected encounters."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0399562249", "primary_isbn13": "9780399562242", "publisher": "Penguin Press", "description": "A biography of the award-winning theater and film director who was also half of the seminal improv duo with Elaine May.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Mike Nichols", "author": "Mark Harris", "contributor": "by Mark Harris", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780399562242.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0399562249?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0399562249", "isbn13": "9780399562242"}, {"isbn10": "0399562257", "isbn13": "9780399562259"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0399562249?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780399562242?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780399562242"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FMIKE%2BNICHOLS%2FMark%2BHarris%2F9780399562242"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780399562242"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780399562242?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/0d3e672f-be52-5ecf-907c-b7a14dcdab7d", "list_date": "2021/02/21", "published_data": "2021-02-02", "summary": "A National Book Critics Circle finalist \u2022 One of People's top 10 books of 2021 \u2022 An instant New York Times bestseller \u2022 Named a best book of the year by NPR and Time A magnificent biography of one of the most protean creative forces in American entertainment history, a life of dazzling highs and vertiginous plunges\u2014some of the worst largely unknown until now\u2014by the acclaimed author of Pictures at a Revolution and Five Came Back Mike Nichols burst onto the scene as a wunderkind: while still in his twenties, he was half of a hit improv duo with Elaine May that was the talk of the country. Next he directed four consecutive hit plays, won back-to-back Tonys, ushered in a new era of Hollywood moviemaking with Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, and followed it with The Graduate, which won him an Oscar and became the third-highest-grossing movie ever. At thirty-five, he lived in a three-story Central Park West penthouse, drove a Rolls-Royce, collected Arabian horses, and counted Jacqueline Kennedy, Elizabeth Taylor, Leonard Bernstein, and Richard Avedon as friends. Where he arrived is even more astonishing given where he had begun: born Igor Peschkowsky to a Jewish couple in Berlin in 1931, he was sent along with his younger brother to America on a ship in 1939. The young immigrant boy caught very few breaks. He was bullied and ostracized--an allergic reaction had rendered him permanently hairless--and his father died when he was just twelve, leaving his mother alone and overwhelmed. The gulf between these two sets of facts explains a great deal about Nichols's transformation from lonely outsider to the center of more than one cultural universe--the acute powers of observation that first made him famous; the nourishment he drew from his creative partnerships, most enduringly with May; his unquenchable drive; his hunger for security and status; and the depressions and self-medications that brought him to terrible lows. It would take decades for him to come to grips with his demons. In an incomparable portrait that follows Nichols from Berlin to New York to Chicago to Hollywood, Mark Harris explores, with brilliantly vivid detail and insight, the life, work, struggle, and passion of an artist and man in constant motion. Among the 250 people Harris interviewed: Elaine May, Meryl Streep, Stephen Sondheim, Robert Redford, Glenn Close, Tom Hanks, Candice Bergen, Emma Thompson, Annette Bening, Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, Lorne Michaels, and Gloria Steinem. Mark Harris gives an intimate and evenhanded accounting of success and failure alike; the portrait is not always flattering, but its ultimate impact is to present the full story of one of the most richly interesting, complicated, and consequential figures the worlds of theater and motion pictures have ever seen.

At its core, racism is a powerful system that creates false hierarchies of human value; its warped logic extends beyond race, from the way we regard people of different ethnicities or skin colors to the way we treat people of different sexes, gender identities, and body types. Racism intersects with class and culture and geography and even changes the way we see and value ourselves. In How to Be an Antiracist, Kendi takes readers through a widening circle of antiracist ideas\u2014from the most basic concepts to visionary possibilities\u2014that will help readers see all forms of racism clearly, understand their poisonous consequences, and work to oppose them in our systems and in ourselves. Kendi weaves an electrifying combination of ethics, history, law, and science with his own personal story of awakening to antiracism.

There is nothing more essential to our health and well-being than breathing: take air in, let it out, repeat twenty-five thousand times a day. Yet, as a species, humans have lost the ability to breathe correctly, with grave consequences. Journalist James Nestor travels the world to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it. The answers aren\u2019t found in pulmonology labs, as we might expect, but in the muddy digs of ancient burial sites, secret Soviet facilities, New Jersey choir schools, and the smoggy streets of S\u00e3o Paulo. Nestor tracks down men and women exploring the hidden science behind ancient breathing practices like Pranayama, Sudarshan Kriya, and Tummo and teams up with pulmonary tinkerers to scientifically test long-held beliefs about how we breathe. Modern research is showing us that making even slight adjustments to the way we inhale and exhale can jump-start athletic performance; rejuvenate internal organs; halt snoring, asthma, and autoimmune disease; and even straighten scoliotic spines. None of this should be possible, and yet it is. Drawing on thousands of years of medical texts and recent cutting-edge studies in pulmonology, psychology, biochemistry, and human physiology, Breath turns the conventional wisdom of what we thought we knew about our most basic biological function on its head.

Here, Didion touches on topics ranging from newspapers (\"the problem is not so much whether one trusts the news as to whether one finds it\"), to the fantasy of San Simeon, to not getting into Stanford. In \"Why I Write,\" Didion ponders the act of writing: \"I write entirely to find out what I'm thinking, what I'm looking at, what I see and what it means.\" From her admiration for Hemingway's sentences to her acknowledgment that Martha Stewart's story is one \"that has historically encouraged women in this country, even as it has threatened men,\" these essays are acutely and brilliantly observed.

Race, as we have come to understand it, is a fiction; but, racism, as we have come to live it, is a fact. The point here is not to impose a new racial hierarchy, but to remove an existing one. After centuries of waiting for white majorities to overturn white supremacy, it seems to me that it has fallen to Black people to do it themselves. Acclaimed columnist and author Charles Blow never wanted to write a \"race book.\" But as violence against Black people-both physical and psychological-seemed only to increase in recent years, culminating in the historical pandemic and protests of the summer of 2020, he felt compelled to write a new story for Black Americans. He envisioned a succinct, counterintuitive, and impassioned corrective to the myths that have for too long governed our thinking about race and geography in America. Drawing on both political observations and personal experience as a Black son of the South, Charles set out to offer a call to action by which Black people can finally achieve equality, on their own terms. So what will it take to make lasting change when small steps have so frequently failed It's going to take an unprecedented shift in power. The Devil You Know is a groundbreaking manifesto, proposing nothing short of the most audacious power play by Black people in the history of this country. This book is a grand exhortation to generations of a people, offering a road map to true and lasting freedom."}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593182537", "primary_isbn13": "9780593182536", "publisher": "Dutton", "description": "An examination of Russian intelligence efforts to collect compromising information on and leverage power against key Americans.", "price": "0.00", "title": "American Kompromat", "author": "Craig Unger", "contributor": "by Craig Unger", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593182536.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593182537?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593182537", "isbn13": "9780593182536"}, {"isbn10": "0593182553", "isbn13": "9780593182550"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593182537?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593182536?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593182536"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FAMERICAN%2BKOMPROMAT%2FCraig%2BUnger%2F9780593182536"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593182536"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593182536?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/39041b39-20a5-5cae-ac01-14a9adec953d", "list_date": "2021/02/14", "published_data": "2021-01-26", "summary": "**THE INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER** Kompromat n.\u2014Russian for \"compromising information\" This is a story about the dirty secrets of the most powerful people in the world\u2014including Donald Trump. Based on exclusive interviews with intelligence officers in the CIA, FBI, and the KGB, thousands of pages of FBI investigations, police investigations, and news articles in English, Russian, and Ukrainian. American Kompromat shows that from Trump to Jeffrey Epstein, kompromat was used in operations far more sinister than the public could ever imagine. The book addresses what may be the single most important unanswered question of the entire Trump era: Is Donald Trump a Russian asset? The answer, American Kompromat says, is yes, supporting that conclusion with the first richly detailed narrative on how the KGB allegedly first \u201cspotted\u201d Trump as a potential asset, how it cultivated him, arranged his first trip to Moscow, and pumped him full of KGB talking points. Among its many revelations, American Kompromat reports for the first time that: \u2022 According to former KGB major Yuri Shvets, Trump first did business over forty years ago with a Manhattan electronics store co-owned by a Soviet \u00e9migr\u00e9, triggering protocols through which the Soviet spy agency began efforts to cultivate Trump as an asset, launching a decades-long \u201crelationship\u201d of mutual benefit to Russia and Trump, from real estate to real power. \u2022 Trump\u2019s 1987 invitation to Moscow was billed as a scouting trip for a hotel, but according to Shvets, was actually initiated by a high-level KGB official. These sorts of trips were usually arranged for \"deep development.\" \u2022 Before Trump\u2019s first Moscow trip, he met with Natalia Dubinin, who worked at the United Nations library in a vital position usually reserved as a cover for KGB operatives. \u2022 In 1987, according to Shvets, the KGB circulated an internal cable hailing the successful execution of an active measure by a newly cultivated American asset who took out full-page ads in The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Boston Globe promoting policies promoted by the KGB. The ads had been taken out by Donald Trump, who, Shvets said, would become a \u201cspecial unofficial contact\u201d for the KGB. In addition to exploring Trump\u2019s ties to the KGB, American Kompromat also reveals: \u2022 How Jeffrey Epstein and Trump jostled for influence and financial supremacy for years. Epstein became a millionaire in part with the help of Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s father\u2014media tycoon Robert Maxwell, who allegedly served as a spy and likely gave Epstein a sum between $10 and $20 million before his death in 1991. \u2022 How the Epstein-Ghislaine Maxwell sex-trafficking operation provided a source and marketplace for sexual kompromat. \u2022 How the Epstein-Maxwell ring helped enable young women with possible ties to Russian intelligence to gain access to the highest levels of Silicon Valley and the worlds of artificial intelligence, supercomputers, and the internet. This, at a time when Vladimir Putin has asserted, \u201cWhoever becomes the leader in this sphere [artificial intelligence] will become the ruler of the world.\u201d \u2022 How John Mark Dougan, a former deputy sheriff in Mar-a-Lago\u2019s Palm Beach County, says he acquired 478 videos confiscated from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, fled to Moscow, became only the fourth American to win asylum in Russia, and immediately gained access to Putin\u2019s inner circle, showing the ongoing power that comes from kompromat and how its value is highest before it is \u201cused.\u201d"}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 10, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1984856022", "primary_isbn13": "9781984856029", "publisher": "Random House", "description": "A collection of essays examining the functions and importance of works of fiction.", "price": "0.00", "title": "A Swim In A Pond In The Rain", "author": "George Saunders", "contributor": "by George Saunders", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781984856029.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1984856022?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1984856022", "isbn13": "9781984856029"}, {"isbn10": "1984856049", "isbn13": "9781984856043"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1984856022?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781984856029?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781984856029"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FA%2BSWIM%2BIN%2BA%2BPOND%2BIN%2BTHE%2BRAIN%2FGeorge%2BSaunders%2F9781984856029"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781984856029"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781984856029?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/bbf540c6-cd16-561e-a548-e0155926be95", "list_date": "2021/02/14", "published_data": "2021-01-12", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 From the Booker Prize\u2013winning author of Lincoln in the Bardo and Tenth of December comes a literary master class on what makes great stories work and what they can tell us about ourselves\u2014and our world today.

In A Swim in a Pond in the Rain, he shares a version of that class with us, offering some of what he and his students have discovered together over the years. Paired with iconic short stories by Chekhov, Turgenev, Tolstoy, and Gogol, the seven essays in this book are intended for anyone interested in how fiction works and why it\u2019s more relevant than ever in these turbulent times. In his introduction, Saunders writes, \u201cWe\u2019re going to enter seven fastidiously constructed scale models of the world, made for a specific purpose that our time maybe doesn\u2019t fully endorse but that these writers accepted implicitly as the aim of art\u2014namely, to ask the big questions, questions like, How are we supposed to be living down here? What were we put here to accomplish? What should we value? What is truth, anyway, and how might we recognize it?\u201d He approaches the stories technically yet accessibly, and through them explains how narrative functions; why we stay immersed in a story and why we resist it; and the bedrock virtues a writer must foster. The process of writing, Saunders reminds us, is a technical craft, but also a way of training oneself to see the world with new openness and curiosity. A Swim in a Pond in the Rain is a deep exploration not just of how great writing works but of how the mind itself works while reading, and of how the reading and writing of stories make genuine connection possible."}, {"rank": 9, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 7, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0525560734", "primary_isbn13": "9780525560739", "publisher": "Penguin", "description": "A memoir by the daughter of immigrants who is currently serving as the 49th vice president.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Truths We Hold", "author": "Kamala Harris", "contributor": "by Kamala Harris", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780525560715.jpg", "book_image_width": 326, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Truths-We-Hold-American-Journey/dp/0525560718?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0525560718", "isbn13": "9780525560715"}, {"isbn10": "0525560726", "isbn13": "9780525560722"}, {"isbn10": "1984886223", "isbn13": "9781984886224"}, {"isbn10": "1984885715", "isbn13": "9781984885715"}, {"isbn10": "0525560734", "isbn13": "9780525560739"}, {"isbn10": "0593103777", "isbn13": "9780593103777"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Truths-We-Hold-American-Journey/dp/0525560718?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780525560739?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780525560739"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BTRUTHS%2BWE%2BHOLD%2FKamala%2BHarris%2F9780525560739"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780525560739"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780525560739?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/b531cb3e-cace-5436-84e9-6a29fad9e0b9", "list_date": "2021/02/07", "published_data": "2020-08-04", "summary": "The #1 New York Times bestseller From Vice President Kamala Harris, one of America's most inspiring political leaders, a book about the core truths that unite us, and the long struggle to discern what those truths are and how best to act upon them, in her own life and across the life of our country \"A life story that genuinely entrances.\" \u2014Los Angeles Times Vice President Kamala Harris's commitment to speaking truth is informed by her upbringing. The daughter of immigrants, she was raised in an Oakland, California community that cared deeply about social justice; her parents--an esteemed economist from Jamaica and an admired cancer researcher from India--met as activists in the civil rights movement when they were graduate students at Berkeley. Growing up, Harris herself never hid her passion for justice, and when she became a prosecutor out of law school, a deputy district attorney, she quickly established herself as one of the most innovative change agents in American law enforcement. She progressed rapidly to become the elected District Attorney for San Francisco, and then the chief law enforcement officer of the state of California as a whole. Known for bringing a voice to the voiceless, she took on the big banks during the foreclosure crisis, winning a historic settlement for California's working families. Her hallmarks were applying a holistic, data-driven approach to many of California's thorniest issues, always eschewing stale \"tough on crime\" rhetoric as presenting a series of false choices. Neither \"tough\" nor \"soft\" but smart on crime became her mantra. Being smart means learning the truths that can make us better as a community, and supporting those truths with all our might. That has been the pole star that guided Harris to a transformational career as the top law enforcement official in California, and it is guiding her now as a transformational United States Senator, grappling with an array of complex issues that affect her state, our country, and the world, from health care and the new economy to immigration, national security, the opioid crisis, and accelerating inequality. By reckoning with the big challenges we face together, drawing on the hard-won wisdom and insight from her own career and the work of those who have most inspired her, Kamala Harris offers in THE TRUTHS WE HOLD a master class in problem solving, in crisis management, and leadership in challenging times. Through the arc of her own life, on into the great work of our day, she communicates a vision of shared struggle, shared purpose, and shared values. In a book rich in many home truths, not least is that a relatively small number of people work very hard to convince a great many of us that we have less in common than we actually do, but it falls to us to look past them and get on with the good work of living our common truth. When we do, our shared effort will continue to sustain us and this great nation, now and in the years to come."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 33, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0807047414", "primary_isbn13": "9780807047415", "publisher": "Beacon Press", "description": "Historical and cultural analyses on what causes defensive moves by white people and how this inhibits cross-racial dialogue.", "price": "0.00", "title": "White Fragility", "author": "Robin DiAngelo", "contributor": "by Robin DiAngelo", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780807047415.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/White-Fragility-People-About-Racism/dp/0807047414?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0807047414", "isbn13": "9780807047415"}, {"isbn10": "0807047422", "isbn13": "9780807047422"}, {"isbn10": "197492341X", "isbn13": "9781974923410"}, {"isbn10": "1974923401", "isbn13": "9781974923403"}, {"isbn10": "0807047406", "isbn13": "9780807047408"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/White-Fragility-People-About-Racism/dp/0807047414?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780807047415?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780807047415"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FWHITE%2BFRAGILITY%2FRobin%2BDiAngelo%2F9780807047415"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780807047415"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780807047415?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/27f88b69-d265-5d7b-8950-01377374e783", "list_date": "2021/02/07", "published_data": "2018-06-26", "summary": "The New York Times best-selling book exploring the counterproductive reactions white people have when their assumptions about race are challenged, and how these reactions maintain racial inequality.

Between the World and Me is Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son\u2014and readers\u2014the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children\u2019s lives were taken as American plunder.

The author of Fantasyland tells the epic history of how America decided that big business gets whatever it wants, only the rich get richer, and nothing should ever change\u2014and charts a way back to the future. \u201cEssential, absorbing . . . a graceful, authoritative guide . . . a radicalized moderate\u2019s moderate case for radical change.\u201d\u2014The New York Times Book Review During the twentieth century, America managed to make its economic and social systems both more and more fair and more and more prosperous. A huge, secure, and contented middle class emerged. All boats rose together. But then the New Deal gave way to the Raw Deal. Beginning in the early 1970s, by means of a long war conceived of and executed by a confederacy of big business CEOs, the superrich, and right-wing zealots, the rules and norms that made the American middle class possible were undermined and dismantled. The clock was turned back on a century of economic progress, making greed good, workers powerless, and the market all-powerful while weaponizing nostalgia, lifting up an oligarchy that served only its own interests, and leaving the huge majority of Americans with dwindling economic prospects and hope. Why and how did America take such a wrong turn? In this deeply researched and brilliantly woven cultural, economic, and political chronicle, Kurt Andersen offers a fresh, provocative, and eye-opening history of America\u2019s undoing, naming names, showing receipts, and unsparingly assigning blame\u2014to the radical right in economics and the law, the high priests of high finance, a complacent and complicit Establishment, and liberal \u201cuseful idiots,\u201d among whom he includes himself. Only a writer with Andersen\u2019s crackling energy, deep insight, and ability to connect disparate dots and see complex systems with clarity could make such a book both intellectually formidable and vastly entertaining. And only a writer of Andersen\u2019s vision could reckon with our current high-stakes inflection point, and show the way out of this man-made disaster."}, {"rank": 9, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1538719363", "primary_isbn13": "9781538719367", "publisher": "Grand Central", "description": "A pair of sisters who live in different parts of the country share their perspectives on the absurdities and everyday experiences of racism.", "price": "0.00", "title": "You'Ll Never Believe What Happened To Lacey", "author": "Amber Ruffin and Lacey Lamar", "contributor": "by Amber Ruffin and Lacey Lamar", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781538719367.jpg", "book_image_width": 338, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1538719363?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1538719363", "isbn13": "9781538719367"}, {"isbn10": "154910540X", "isbn13": "9781549105401"}, {"isbn10": "154916242X", "isbn13": "9781549162428"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1538719363?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781538719367?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781538719367"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FYOU%2527LL%2BNEVER%2BBELIEVE%2BWHAT%2BHAPPENED%2BTO%2BLACEY%2FAmber%2BRuffin%2Band%2BLacey%2BLamar%2F9781538719367"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781538719367"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781538719367?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/3ba0ba33-b92f-5b55-a5e8-88c428f33e2e", "list_date": "2021/01/31", "published_data": "2021-01-12", "summary": "A writer and performer on Late Night with Seth Meyers and her sister share absurd anecdotes about everyday experiences of racism."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1250799120", "primary_isbn13": "9781250799128", "publisher": "Flatiron", "description": "The former F.B.I. director incorporates his experiences into lessons on how the federal justice system functions.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Saving Justice", "author": "James Comey", "contributor": "by James Comey", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781250799128.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250799120?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1250799120", "isbn13": "9781250799128"}, {"isbn10": "1250799139", "isbn13": "9781250799135"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250799120?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781250799128?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781250799128"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FSAVING%2BJUSTICE%2FJames%2BComey%2F9781250799128"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781250799128"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250799128?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/9489a092-d025-5b25-a669-0d2cc91d5e8b", "list_date": "2021/01/31", "published_data": "2021-01-12", "summary": "James Comey, former FBI Director and New York Times bestselling author of A Higher Loyalty, uses his long career in federal law enforcement to explore issues of justice and fairness in the US justice system. James Comey might best be known as the FBI director that Donald Trump fired in 2017, but he\u2019s had a long, varied career in the law and justice system. He knows better than most just what a force for good the US justice system can be, and how far afield it has strayed during the Trump Presidency. In his much-anticipated follow-up to A Higher Loyalty, Comey uses anecdotes and lessons from his career to show how the federal justice system works. From prosecuting mobsters as an Assistant US Attorney in the Southern District of New York in the 1980s to grappling with the legalities of anti-terrorism work as the Deputy Attorney General in the early 2000s to, of course, his tumultuous stint as FBI director beginning in 2013, Comey shows just how essential it is to pursue the primacy of truth for federal law enforcement.

Since debuting as the host of Jeopardy! in 1984, Alex Trebek has been something like a family member to millions of television viewers, bringing entertainment and education into their homes five nights a week. Last year, he made the stunning announcement that he had been diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer. What followed was an incredible outpouring of love and kindness. Social media was flooded with messages of support, and the Jeopardy! studio received boxes of cards and letters offering guidance, encouragement, and prayers. For over three decades, Trebek had resisted countless appeals to write a book about his life. Yet he was moved so much by all the goodwill, he felt compelled to finally share his story. \u201cI want people to know a little more about the person they have been cheering on for the past year,\u201d he writes in The Answer Is\u2026: Reflections on My Life. The book combines illuminating personal anecdotes with Trebek\u2019s thoughts on a range of topics, including marriage, parenthood, education, success, spirituality, and philanthropy. Trebek also addresses the questions he gets asked most often by Jeopardy! fans, such as what prompted him to shave his signature mustache, his insights on legendary players like Ken Jennings and James Holzhauer, and his opinion of Will Ferrell\u2019s Saturday Night Live impersonation. The book uses a novel structure inspired by Jeopardy!, with each chapter title in the form of a question, and features dozens of never-before-seen photos that candidly capture Trebek over the years. This wise, charming, and inspiring book is further evidence why Trebek has long been considered one of the most beloved and respected figures in entertainment."}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 7, "weeks_on_list": 4, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593136683", "primary_isbn13": "9780593136683", "publisher": "Crown", "description": "The MSNBC host gives an account of the 1973 investigation of then Vice President Spiro T.

The year was 1973, and Spiro T. Agnew, the former governor of Maryland, was Richard Nixon\u2019s second-in-command. Long on firebrand rhetoric and short on political experience, Agnew had carried out a bribery and extortion ring in office for years, when\u2014at the height of Watergate\u2014three young federal prosecutors discovered his crimes and launched a mission to take him down before it was too late, before Nixon\u2019s impending downfall elevated Agnew to the presidency.

Mark David Chapman was one of the most invisible. By the end of 1980, the Beatles had been broken up for a decade -- a decade John Lennon had spent in search of his true identity: singer, songwriter, activist, burn out. \"It's the perfect time to be coming back,\" he declared. Except that Lennon was a marked man. As early as the Beatles' controversial 1966 American tour, the band had feared for their safety. \"You might as well put a target on me,\" Lennon said, and the Nixon administration complied by opening an FBI file. If only the agents hadn't been so intently focused on the star himself, they might have detected Mark David Chapman's powerful, ever-growing obsession with his onetime idol. Chapman, himself a tragic nowhere man, ultimately achieved the notoriety he craved by actualizing the target on Lennon -- single-handedly wounding the spirit of a generation\"--Publisher's description."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 12, "weeks_on_list": 12, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1501145258", "primary_isbn13": "9781501145254", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "description": "A collection of articles and speeches by the Supreme Court justice.", "price": "0.00", "title": "My Own Words", "author": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg with Mary Hartnett and Wendy W.

The disintegration of this group, a process that has been slowly occurring now for more than forty years, has been reported with growing frequency and alarm, but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside. J. D. Vance tells the true story of what a social, regional, and class decline feels like when you were born with it hung around your neck. The Vance family story begins hopefully in postwar America. J. D.\u2019s grandparents were \u201cdirt poor and in love,\u201d and moved north from Kentucky\u2019s Appalachia region to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. They raised a middle-class family, and eventually one of their grandchildren would graduate from Yale Law School, a conventional marker of success in achieving generational upward mobility. But as the family saga of Hillbilly Elegy plays out, we learn that J.D.'s grandparents, aunt, uncle, sister, and, most of all, his mother struggled profoundly with the demands of their new middle-class life, never fully escaping the legacy of abuse, alcoholism, poverty, and trauma so characteristic of their part of America. With piercing honesty, Vance shows how he himself still carries around the demons of his chaotic family history. A deeply moving memoir, with its share of humor and vividly colorful figures, Hillbilly Elegy is the story of how upward mobility really feels. And it is an urgent and troubling meditation on the loss of the American dream for a large segment of this country."}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 3, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1797205099", "primary_isbn13": "9781797205090", "publisher": "Chronicle", "description": "The country music icon offers insights on 175 of her songs.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Dolly Parton, Songteller", "author": "Dolly Parton with Robert K Oermann", "contributor": "by Dolly Parton with Robert K.

Fox. The entire world knows Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly, the teenage sidekick of Doc Brown in Back to the Future; as Alex P. Keaton in Family Ties; as Mike Flaherty in Spin City; and through numerous other movie roles and guest appearances on shows such as The Good Wife and Curb Your Enthusiasm. Diagnosed at age 29, Michael is equally engaged in Parkinson\u2019s advocacy work, raising global awareness of the disease and helping find a cure through The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research, the world\u2019s leading non-profit funder of PD science. His two previous bestselling memoirs, Lucky Man and Always Looking Up, dealt with how he came to terms with the illness, all the while exhibiting his iconic optimism. His new memoir reassesses this outlook, as events in the past decade presented additional challenges. In No Time Like the Future: An Optimist Considers Mortality, Michael shares personal stories and observations about illness and health, aging, the strength of family and friends, and how our perceptions about time affect the way we approach mortality. Thoughtful and moving, but with Fox\u2019s trademark sense of humor, his book provides a vehicle for reflection about our lives, our loves, and our losses. Running through the narrative is the drama of the medical madness Fox recently experienced, that included his daily negotiations with the Parkinson\u2019s disease he\u2019s had since 1991, and a spinal cord issue that necessitated immediate surgery. His challenge to learn how to walk again, only to suffer a devastating fall, nearly caused him to ditch his trademark optimism and \u201cget out of the lemonade business altogether.\u201d Does he make it all of the way back?

In the COVID crisis, the beloved shepherd of over one billion Catholics saw the cruelty and inequity of our society exposed more vividly than ever before. He also saw, in the resilience, generosity, and creativity of so many people, the means to rescue our society, our economy, and our planet. In direct, powerful prose, Pope Francis urges us not to let the pain be in vain. He begins Let Us Dream by exploring what this crisis can teach us about how to handle upheaval of any kind in our own lives and the world at large. With unprecedented candor, he reveals how three crises in his own life changed him dramatically for the better. By its very nature, he shows, crisis presents us with a choice: we make a grievous error if we try to return to some pre-crisis state. But if we have the courage to change, we can emerge from the crisis better than before. Francis then offers a brilliant, scathing critique of the systems and ideologies that conspired to produce the current crisis, from a global economy obsessed with profit and heedless of the people and environment it harms, to politicians who foment their people\u2019s fear and use it to increase their own power at their people\u2019s expense. He reminds us that Christians\u2019 first duty is to serve others, especially the poor and the marginalized, just as Jesus did. Finally, the Pope offers an inspiring and actionable blueprint for building a better world for all humanity by putting the poor and the planet at the heart of new thinking. For this plan, he draws not only on sacred sources, but on the latest findings from renowned scientists, economists, activists, and other thinkers. Yet rather than simply offer prescriptions, he shows how ordinary people acting together despite their differences can discover unforeseen possibilities. Along the way, he offers dozens of wise and surprising observations on the value of unconventional thinking, on why we must dramatically increase women\u2019s leadership in the Church and throughout society, on what he learned while scouring the streets of Buenos Aires with garbage-pickers, and much more. Let Us Dream is an epiphany, a call to arms, and a pleasure to read. It is Pope Francis at his most personal, profound and passionate. With this book and with open hearts, we can change the world."}, {"rank": 5, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0062962752", "primary_isbn13": "9780062962751", "publisher": "Morrow", "description": "The host of the Food Network show \u201cThe Pioneer Woman\u201d shares stories on motherhood and marriage.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Frontier Follies", "author": "Ree Drummond", "contributor": "by Ree Drummond", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780062962751.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062962752?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0062962752", "isbn13": "9780062962751"}, {"isbn10": "0062962825", "isbn13": "9780062962829"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062962752?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780062962751?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780062962751"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FFRONTIER%2BFOLLIES%2FRee%2BDrummond%2F9780062962751"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780062962751"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062962751?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/b5278eff-3ac1-5c2d-969f-242d63e9fc22", "list_date": "2020/12/06", "published_data": "2020-11-17", "summary": "A warm, hilarious collection of stories and reflections on motherhood from the #1 New York Times bestselling author, photographer, businesswoman, and star of the Food Network show The Pioneer Woman, Ree Drummond.

Trying to get as close to the source as he could, Ricks decided to go back and read the philosophy and literature that shaped the founders' thinking, and the letters they wrote to each other debating these crucial works--among them the Iliad, Plutarch's Lives, and the works of Xenophon, Epicurus, Aristotle, Cato, and Cicero. For though much attention has been paid the influence of English political philosophers, like John Locke, closer to their own era, the founders were far more immersed in the literature of the ancient world. The first four American presidents came to their classical knowledge differently. Washington absorbed it mainly from the elite culture of his day; Adams from the laws and rhetoric of Rome; Jefferson immersed himself in classical philosophy, especially Epicureanism; and Madison, both a groundbreaking researcher and a deft politician, spent years studying the ancient world like a political scientist. Each of their experiences, and distinctive learning, played an essential role in the formation of the United States. In examining how and what they studied, looking at them in the unusual light of the classical world, Ricks is able to draw arresting and fresh portraits of men we thought we knew. First Principles follows these four members of the Revolutionary generation from their youths to their adult lives, as they grappled with questions of independence, and forming and keeping a new nation. In doing so, Ricks interprets not only the effect of the ancient world on each man, and how that shaped our constitution and government, but offers startling new insights into these legendary leaders."}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0735221251", "primary_isbn13": "9780735221253", "publisher": "Penguin Press", "description": "How Julian Van Winkle III worked to preserve the legacy of his family\u2019s brand of Kentucky bourbon.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Pappyland", "author": "Wright Thompson", "contributor": "by Wright Thompson", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780735221253.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0735221251?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0735221251", "isbn13": "9780735221253"}, {"isbn10": "0735221278", "isbn13": "9780735221277"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0735221251?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780735221253?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780735221253"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FPAPPYLAND%2FWright%2BThompson%2F9780735221253"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780735221253"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780735221253?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/f53e2c33-cb76-5d6d-b74a-dd93ac46a9d2", "list_date": "2020/11/29", "published_data": "2020-11-10", "summary": "An instant New York Times bestseller From the bestselling author of The Cost of These Dreams The story of how Julian Van Winkle III, the caretaker of the most coveted cult Kentucky Bourbon whiskey in the world, fought to protect his family's heritage and preserve the taste of his forebears, in a world where authenticity, like his product, is in very short supply. As a journalist said of Pappy Van Winkle, \"You could call it bourbon, or you could call it a $5,000 bottle of liquified, barrel-aged unobtanium.\" Julian Van Winkle, the third-generation head of his family's business, is now thought of as something like the Buddha of Bourbon - Booze Yoda, as Wright Thompson calls him. He is swarmed wherever he goes, and people stand in long lines to get him to sign their bottles of Pappy Van Winkle Family Reserve, the whiskey he created to honor his grandfather, the founder of the family concern. A bottle of the 23-year-old Pappy starts at $3000 on the internet. As Julian is the first to say, things have gone completely nuts. Forty years ago, Julian would have laughed in astonishment if you'd told him what lay ahead. He'd just stepped in to try to save the business after his father had died, partly of heartbreak, having been forced to sell the old distillery in a brutal downturn in the market for whiskey. Julian's grandfather had presided over a magical kingdom of craft and connoisseurship, a genteel outfit whose family ethos generated good will throughout Kentucky and far beyond. There's always a certain amount of romance to the marketing of spirits, but Pappy's mission statement captured something real: \"We make fine bourbon - at a profit if we can, at a loss if we must, but always fine bourbon.\" But now the business had hit the wilderness years, and Julian could only hang on for dear life, stubbornly committed to preserving his namesake's legacy or going down with the ship. Then something like a miracle happened: it turned out that hundreds of very special barrels of whiskey from the Van Winkle family distillery had been saved by the multinational conglomerate that bought it. With no idea what they had, they offered to sell it to Julian, who scrambled to beg and borrow the funds. Now he could bottle a whiskey whose taste captured his family's legacy. The result would immediately be hailed as the greatest whiskey in the world - and would soon be the hardest to find. But now, those old barrels were used up, and Julian Van Winkle faced the challenge of his lifetime: how to preserve the taste of Pappy, the taste of his family's heritage, in a new age? The amazing Wright Thompson was invited to be his wingman as he set about to try. The result is an extraordinary testimony to the challenge of living up to your legacy and the rewards that come from knowing and honoring your people and your craft. Wright learned those lessons from Julian as they applied to the honest work of making a great bourbon whiskey in Kentucky, but he couldn't help applying them to his own craft, writing, and his upbringing in Mississippi, as he and his wife contemplated the birth of their first child. May we all be lucky enough to find some of ourselves, as Wright Thompson did, in Julian Van Winkle, and in Pappyland."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 9, "weeks_on_list": 9, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1982133279", "primary_isbn13": "9781982133276", "publisher": "Threshold Editions", "description": "The conservative commentator makes her case that Black Americans should part ways with the Democratic Party.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Blackout", "author": "Candace Owens", "contributor": "by Candace Owens", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781982133276.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982133279?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1982133279", "isbn13": "9781982133276"}, {"isbn10": "1982133295", "isbn13": "9781982133290"}, {"isbn10": "1797105507", "isbn13": "9781797105505"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982133279?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781982133276?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781982133276"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FBLACKOUT%2FCandace%2BOwens%2F9781982133276"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781982133276"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781982133276?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/939abb21-e146-5f6d-82d3-a8b4deefb2b5", "list_date": "2020/11/29", "published_data": "2020-09-15", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER It\u2019s time for a black exit. Political activist and social media star Candace Owens addresses the many ways that Democrat Party policies hurt, rather than help, the African American community, and why she and many others are turning right. Black Americans have long been shackled to the Democrats. Seeing no viable alternative, they have watched liberal politicians take the black vote for granted without pledging anything in return. In Blackout, Owens argues that this automatic allegiance is both illogical and unearned. She contends that the Democrat Party has a long history of racism and exposes the ideals that hinder the black community\u2019s ability to rise above poverty, live independent and successful lives, and be an active part of the American Dream. Instead, Owens offers up a different ideology by issuing a challenge: It\u2019s time for a major black exodus. From dependency, from victimhood, from miseducation\u2014and the Democrat Party, which perpetuates all three. Owens explains that government assistance is a double-edged sword, that the Left dismisses the faith so important to the black community, that Democrat permissiveness toward abortion disproportionately affects black babies, that the #MeToo movement hurts black men, and much more. Weaving in her personal story, which ushered her from a roach-infested low-income apartment to1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, she demonstrates how she overcame her setbacks and challenges despite the cultural expectation that she should embrace a victim mentality. Well-researched and intelligently argued, Blackout lays bare the myth that all black people should vote Democrat\u2014and shows why turning to the right will leave them happier, more successful, and more self-sufficient."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 5, "weeks_on_list": 13, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0316421820", "primary_isbn13": "9780316421829", "publisher": "Voracious/Little, Brown", "description": "The former White House photographer juxtaposes pictures of former President Obama with tweets, headlines and quotes from the Trump administration.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Shade", "author": "Pete Souza", "contributor": "by Pete Souza", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780316421829.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 444, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Shade-Tale-Presidents-Pete-Souza/dp/0316421820?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0316421820", "isbn13": "9780316421829"}, {"isbn10": "0316421839", "isbn13": "9780316421836"}, {"isbn10": "0316455040", "isbn13": "9780316455046"}, {"isbn10": "031645821X", "isbn13": "9780316458214"}, {"isbn10": "0316490377", "isbn13": "9780316490375"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Shade-Tale-Presidents-Pete-Souza/dp/0316421820?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780316421829?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780316421829"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FSHADE%2FPete%2BSouza%2F9780316421829"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780316421829"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780316421829?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/ce91afe6-892e-59ca-bcb2-fde5128cb44e", "list_date": "2020/11/29", "published_data": "2018-10-16", "summary": "From Pete Souza, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Obama: An Intimate Portrait, comes a potent commentary on the Presidency--and our country. As Chief Official White House Photographer, Pete Souza spent more time alongside President Barack Obama than almost anyone else. His years photographing the President gave him an intimate behind-the-scenes view of the unique gravity of the Office of the Presidency--and the tremendous responsibility that comes with it. Now, as a concerned citizen observing the Trump administration, he is standing up and speaking out. Shade is a portrait in Presidential contrasts, telling the tale of the Obama and Trump administrations through a series of visual juxtapositions. Here, more than one hundred of Souza's unforgettable images of President Obama deliver new power and meaning when framed by the tweets, news headlines, and quotes that defined the first 500 days of the Trump White House. What began with Souza's Instagram posts soon after President Trump's inauguration in January 2017 has become a potent commentary on the state of the Presidency, and our country. Some call this \"throwing shade.\" Souza calls it telling the truth. In Shade, Souza's photographs are more than a rejoinder to the chaos, abuses of power, and destructive policies that now define our nation's highest office. They are a reminder of a President we could believe in, and a courageous defense of American values."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0062995464", "primary_isbn13": "9780062995469", "publisher": "Morrow", "description": "In 1967, a former Marine agrees to sneak into Vietnam to deliver brews to friends still serving.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Greatest Beer Run Ever", "author": "John \u201cChick\u201d Donohue and J.T.

Pete Souza served as Chief Official White House Photographer for President Obama's full two terms. He was with the President during more crucial moments than anyone else--and he photographed them all. Souza took nearly two million photographs of President Obama, capturing moments both highly classified and disarmingly candid. Obama: An Intimate Portrait reproduces Souza's most iconic photographs in exquisite detail, more than three hundred in all. Some have never been published. These photographs document the most consequential hours of the Presidency--including the historic image of President Obama and his advisors in the Situation Room during the bin Laden mission--alongside unguarded moments with the President's family, his encounters with children, interactions with world leaders and cultural figures, and more. Souza's photographs, with the behind-the-scenes captions and stories that accompany them, communicate the pace and power of our nation's highest office.

We see President Obama lead our nation through monumental challenges, comfort us in calamity and loss, share in hard-won victories, and set a singular example to \"be kind and be useful,\" as he would instruct his daughters.

In the first single-volume cradle-to-grave portrait in six decades, acclaimed biographer David Michaelis delivers a stunning account of Eleanor Roosevelt\u2019s remarkable life of transformation. An orphaned niece of President Theodore Roosevelt, she converted her Gilded Age childhood of denial and secrecy into an irreconcilable marriage with her ambitious fifth cousin Franklin. Despite their inability to make each other happy, Franklin Roosevelt transformed Eleanor from a settlement house volunteer on New York\u2019s Lower East Side into a matching partner in New York\u2019s most important power couple in a generation. When Eleanor discovered Franklin\u2019s betrayal with her younger, prettier social secretary, Lucy Mercer, she offered a divorce and vowed to face herself honestly. Here is an Eleanor both more vulnerable and more aggressive, more psychologically aware and sexually adaptable than we knew. She came to accept FDR\u2019s bond with his executive assistant, Missy LeHand; she allowed her children to live their own lives, as she never could; and she explored her sexual attraction to women, among them a star female reporter on FDR\u2019s first presidential campaign, and younger men. Eleanor needed emotional connection. She pursued deeper relationships wherever she could find them. Throughout her life and travels, there was always another person or place she wanted to heal. As FDR struggled to recover from polio, Eleanor became a voice for the voiceless, her husband\u2019s proxy in presidential ambition, and then the people\u2019s proxy in the White House. Later, she would be the architect of international human rights and world citizen of the Atomic Age, urging Americans to cope with the anxiety of global annihilation by cultivating a \u201cworld mind.\u201d She insisted that we cannot live for ourselves alone but must learn to live together or we will die together. Drawing on new research, Michaelis\u2019s riveting portrait is not just a comprehensive biography of a major American figure, but the story of an American ideal: how our freedom is always a choice. Eleanor rediscovers a model of what is noble and evergreen in the American character, a model we need today more than ever."}, {"rank": 4, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1982154616", "primary_isbn13": "9781982154615", "publisher": "Avid Reader", "description": "A law student grappling with feelings of sadness and isolation is invited to join a psychotherapy group.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Group", "author": "Christie Tate", "contributor": "by Christie Tate", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781982154615.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982154616?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1982154616", "isbn13": "9781982154615"}, {"isbn10": "1982154632", "isbn13": "9781982154639"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982154616?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781982154615?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781982154615"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FGROUP%2FChristie%2BTate%2F9781982154615"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781982154615"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781982154615?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/747393f6-29cb-5a11-8089-96df1a10d0b9", "list_date": "2020/11/15", "published_data": "2020-10-27", "summary": "A REESE\u2019S BOOK CLUB PICK AND INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u201cOften hilarious and ultimately very touching.\u201d \u2014People \u201cHave you ever read a book that made you want to hug the author?\u201d \u2014Reese Witherspoon \u201cThis unrestrained memoir is a transporting experience and one of the most startlingly hopeful books I have ever read.\u201d \u2014Lisa Taddeo, New York Times bestselling author of Three Women The refreshingly original debut memoir of a guarded, over-achieving, self-lacerating young lawyer who reluctantly agrees to get psychologically and emotionally naked in a room of six complete strangers\u2014her psychotherapy group\u2014and in turn finds human connection, and herself.

For many Americans, it was the most important reason to choose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. Americans know that the Supreme Court protects our Constitutional rights-or at least it's supposed to. If controlled by activist judges, however, the Court can gravely damage our basic liberties. And to many, the inner workings of the Court remain a mystery. Senator Ted Cruz-a former law clerk to the Chief Justice and one of the country's top Supreme Court advocates-aims to change that in this riveting new book. Taking readers behind the scenes of landmark constitutional battles, many of which he himself litigated, he reveals the power of a single Justice to affect the life and liberty of every American-for good or for ill. As we head into the 2020 presidential election, the control of the Supreme Court, and with it the fate of our Constitution, hangs in the balance. Senator Cruz's timely and essential book takes readers behind the curtain of America's Highest Court and shows how just one more Justice on either side can preserve our liberties-or destroy them."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593239261", "primary_isbn13": "9780593239261", "publisher": "Crown", "description": "The New York State governor gives his perspective on the Covid-19 crisis and prescribes ways to deal with future disasters.", "price": "0.00", "title": "American Crisis", "author": "Andrew Cuomo", "contributor": "by Andrew Cuomo", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593239261.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593239261?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593239261", "isbn13": "9780593239261"}, {"isbn10": "0593239679", "isbn13": "9780593239674"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593239261?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593239261?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593239261"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FAMERICAN%2BCRISIS%2FAndrew%2BCuomo%2F9780593239261"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593239261"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593239261?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/539d797f-02ae-52bf-af7b-9dffa4839e54", "list_date": "2020/11/15", "published_data": "2020-10-13", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 Governor Andrew Cuomo tells the riveting story of how he took charge in the fight against COVID-19 as New York became the epicenter of the pandemic, offering hard-won lessons in leadership and his vision for the path forward. \u201cAn impressive road map to dealing with a crisis as serious as any we have faced.\u201d\u2014The Washington Post When COVID-19 besieged the United States, New York State emerged as the global \u201cground zero\u201d for a deadly contagion that threatened the lives and livelihoods of millions. Quickly, Governor Andrew Cuomo provided the leadership to address the threat, becoming the standard-bearer of the organized response the country desperately needed. With infection rates spiking and more people dying every day, the systems and functions necessary to combat the pandemic in New York\u2014and America\u2014did not exist. So Cuomo undertook the impossible. He unified people to rise to the challenge and was relentless in his pursuit of scientific facts and data. He quelled fear while implementing an extraordinary plan for flattening the curve of infection. He and his team worked day and night to protect the people of New York, despite roadblocks presented by a president incapable of leadership and addicted to transactional politics. Taking readers beyond the candid daily briefings that became must-see TV across the globe, and providing a dramatic, day-by-day account of the catastrophe as it unfolded, American Crisis presents the intimate and inspiring thoughts of a leader at an unprecedented historical moment. In his own voice, Andrew Cuomo chronicles the ingenuity and sacrifice required of so many to fight the pandemic, sharing the decision-making that shaped his policy as well as his frank accounting and assessment of his interactions with the federal government, the White House, and other state and local political and health officials. Real leadership, he shows, requires clear communication, compassion for others, and a commitment to truth-telling\u2014no matter how frightening the facts may be. Including a game plan for what we as individuals\u2014and as a nation\u2014need to do to protect ourselves against this disaster and those to come, American Crisis is a remarkable portrait of selfless leadership and a gritty story of difficult choices that points the way to a safer future for all of us."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 9, "weeks_on_list": 7, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "198213173X", "primary_isbn13": "9781982131739", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "description": "Based on 17 on-the-record interviews with President Trump and other reporting, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist details the president\u2019s perspective on multiple crises.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Rage", "author": "Bob Woodward", "contributor": "by Bob Woodward", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781982131739.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/198213173X?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "198213173X", "isbn13": "9781982131739"}, {"isbn10": "1982131764", "isbn13": "9781982131760"}, {"isbn10": "1797113038", "isbn13": "9781797113036"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/198213173X?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781982131739?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781982131739"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FRAGE%2FBob%2BWoodward%2F9781982131739"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781982131739"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781982131739?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/024e43ba-1556-5c81-beae-c5644de9ae4a", "list_date": "2020/11/15", "published_data": "2020-09-15", "summary": "Bob Woodward\u2019s new book, Rage, is an unprecedented and intimate tour de force of new reporting on the Trump presidency facing a global pandemic, economic disaster and racial unrest.

In dramatic detail, Woodward takes readers into the Oval Office as Trump\u2019s head pops up when he is told in January 2020 that the pandemic could reach the scale of the 1918 Spanish Flu that killed 675,000 Americans. In 17 on-the-record interviews with Woodward over seven volatile months\u2014an utterly vivid window into Trump\u2019s mind\u2014the president provides a self-portrait that is part denial and part combative interchange mixed with surprising moments of doubt as he glimpses the perils in the presidency and what he calls the \u201cdynamite behind every door.\u201d At key decision points, Rage shows how Trump\u2019s responses to the crises of 2020 were rooted in the instincts, habits and style he developed during his first three years as president. Revisiting the earliest days of the Trump presidency, Rage reveals how Secretary of Defense James Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats struggled to keep the country safe as the president dismantled any semblance of collegial national security decision making. Rage draws from hundreds of hours of interviews with firsthand witnesses as well as participants\u2019 notes, emails, diaries, calendars and confidential documents. Woodward obtained 25 never-seen personal letters exchanged between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who describes the bond between the two leaders as out of a \u201cfantasy film.\u201d Trump insists to Woodward he will triumph over Covid-19 and the economic calamity. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Bob.

Tom Fitton\u2019s first two New York Times bestselling books, The Corruption Chronicles and Clean House, exposed the hypocrisy and corruption of Obama\u2019s two terms. Now, in Fitton\u2019s latest investigative probe, he identifies the four major forces posing a continued threat to American democracy. Deep State Efforts to Destroy the Trump Presidency: How the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign paid for the fraudulent anti-Trump \u201cSteele Dossier,\u201d and how it was used by the Obama FBI and DOJ to dupe the FISA Court to allow it to spy on the Trump presidential campaign AND President Trump. These and more dirty secrets of Obamagate and the impeachment coup attempt are exposed. Hillary Clinton Email Scandal: How the Clinton team and senior officials at the Obama State Department conspired to cover up Hillary Clinton\u2019s secret email system\u2014and shocking revelations that tie the Obama White House to the cover-up! Voter Fraud: How Soros-funded groups attack states that seek to protect clean elections by challenging voter ID laws, and how the Left is cynically peddling COVID-19 crisis electoral \u201creforms,\u201d such as mail-in voting, which could increase voter fraud and election chaos. And shocking numbers about dirty voting rolls across the nation! Illegal Immigration: How deadly illegal \u201csanctuary\u201d policies are exploding across America, and how our nation\u2019s sovereignty has been under assault by radical open-border advocates. Subversive Deep State collaborators with ties to the Clinton and Obama machines not only launched countless\u2014often illegal\u2014operations to stop and then remove Trump, but even more alarmingly, are working to transform the United States into something truly unrecognizable to all who believe in liberty and the rule of law. Today one of their main targets is President Donald J. Trump. Tomorrow it could be you and anyone who believes in the US Constitution, believes the United States must have clearly defined and protected borders, believes in the need for a strong military, believes in the value of hard work and faith, and believes in the rule of law and American exceptionalism."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0316425311", "primary_isbn13": "9780316425315", "publisher": "Hachette", "description": "Key career moments are recounted by the musician inducted into the 2020 Grammy Hall of Fame for his album \"Frampton Comes Alive!\"", "price": "0.00", "title": "Do You Feel Like I Do?", "author": "Peter Frampton with Alan Light", "contributor": "by Peter Frampton with Alan Light", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780316425315.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316425311?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0316425311", "isbn13": "9780316425315"}, {"isbn10": "0306923750", "isbn13": "9780306923753"}, {"isbn10": "0316425338", "isbn13": "9780316425339"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316425311?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780316425315?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780316425315"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FDO%2BYOU%2BFEEL%2BLIKE%2BI%2BDO%253F%2FPeter%2BFrampton%2Bwith%2BAlan%2BLight%2F9780316425315"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780316425315"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780316425315?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/f412fa21-7603-54ee-9f2e-747c3cc378c4", "list_date": "2020/11/08", "published_data": "2020-10-20", "summary": "A revelatory memoir by rock icon and legendary guitarist Peter Frampton. Do You Feel Like I Do? is the incredible story of Peter Frampton's positively resilient life and career told in his own words for the first time. His groundbreaking album Frampton Comes Alive! spawned three top-20 singles and sold 8 million copies the year it was released (over 17 million to date) and was inducted into the GRAMMY Hall of Fame in January. Frampton was on a path to stardom from an early age. By 22, he was touring incessantly and making use of the talk box which would become his signature guitar effect. \"I started playing music so young that I sometimes feel I've lived more than one lifetime already,\" says Frampton. The artist shares fascinating stories of his collaborative work and tours with the likes of George Harrison and David Bowie, among others, and reveals both the blessing and curse of Frampton Comes Alive!. And he opens up about becoming the heartthrob and cover boy he never wanted to be, his overcoming substance abuse, and how he's continued to play at the top of his game despite an inflammatory muscle disease. Peppered throughout his narrative is the story of his favorite guitar, which he thought he'd lost in a plane crash in 1980. But in 2011, it mysteriously showed up again - saved from the wreckage. Frampton will tell of that unlikely reunion here in full for the first time, and it is emblematic of his life and career as a legendary artist. \"This is my journey,\" Frampton says of the book. \"All I ever wanted to do was play guitar and it's taken me many different places - physically and mentally. I've been to the moon and back without a rocket, but also to the depths of despair. You never stop paying your dues. Failure has been my greatest inspiration. I brush myself off and then I want to 'do it again.'

The Inside Story of the Real President Trump, by His Former Attorney and Personal Advisor\u2014The Man Who Helped Get Him Into the Oval Office Once Donald Trump\u2019s fiercest surrogate, closest confidant, and staunchest defender, Michael Cohen knows where the skeletons are buried. This is the most devastating business and political horror story of the century. As Trump\u2019s lawyer and \u201cfixer,\u201d Cohen not only witnessed firsthand but was also an active participant in the inner workings of Trump\u2019s business empire, political campaign, and presidential administration. This is a story that you have not read in newspapers, or on social media, or watched on television. These are accounts that only someone who worked for Trump around the clock for over a decade\u2014not a few months or even a couple of years\u2014could know. Cohen describes Trump\u2019s racist rants against President Barack Obama, Nelson Mandela, and Black and Hispanic people in general, as well as the cruelty, humiliation, and abuse he leveled at family and staff. Whether he\u2019s exposing the fact that Trump engaged in tax fraud by inflating his wealth or electronic fraud by rigging an online survey, or outing Trump\u2019s Neanderthal views towards women or his hush-money payments to clandestine lovers, Cohen pulls no punches. He shows Trump\u2019s relentless willingness to lie, exaggerate, mislead, or manipulate.

Friday, January 6, 2017: On that day, as always, John Brennan\u2019s alarm clock was set to go off at 4:15 a.m. But nothing else about that day would be routine. That day marked his first and only security briefing with President-elect Donald Trump. And it was also the day John Brennan said his final farewell to Owen Brennan, his father, the man who had taught him the lessons of goodness, integrity, and honor that had shaped the course of an unparalleled career serving his country from within the intelligence community. In this brutally honest memoir, Brennan, the son of an Irish immigrant who settled in New Jersey, describes the life that took him from being a young CIA recruit enamored with the mystique of spy work, secretly defiant enough to drive a motorcycle and sport a diamond earring, and invigorated by his travels in the Middle East to being the most powerful individual in American intelligence. He details his experiences with very different presidents and what it\u2019s been like to bear responsibility for some of the nation\u2019s most crucial and polarizing national security decisions. He pulls back the curtain on the inner workings of the Agency, describing the selfless, patriotic, and invisible work of the women and men involved in national security. He also examines the insularity, arrogance, and myopia that have, at times, undermined its reputation in the eyes of the American people and of members of other branches of government. Through topics ranging from George W. Bush\u2019s intervention in Iraq to his thoughts on the CIA\u2019s controversial use of enhanced interrogation techniques to his eye-opening account of the planning of the raid that resulted in Bin Ladin\u2019s death to his realization that Russia had interfered with the 2016 election, Brennan brings the reader behind the scenes of some of the most crucial moments in recent U.S. history. He also candidly discusses the times he has failed to live up to his own high standards and the very public fallouts that have resulted. With its behind-the-scenes look at how major U.S. national security policies and actions unfolded during his long and distinguished career\u2014especially during his eight years in the Obama administration\u2014John Brennan\u2019s memoir is a work of history with strong implications for the future of America and our country\u2019s relationships with other world powers. Undaunted: My Fight Against America\u2019s Enemies, at Home and Abroad offers a rare and insightful look at the often-obscured world of national security, the intelligence profession, and Washington\u2019s chaotic political environment. But more than that, it is a portrait of a man striving for integrity; for himself, for the CIA, and for his country."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1631498770", "primary_isbn13": "9781631498770", "publisher": "Liveright", "description": "The former mayor of South Bend and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate prescribes ways to restore what he considers an essential element of America\u2019s democracy.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Trust", "author": "Pete Buttigieg", "contributor": "by Pete Buttigieg", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781631498770.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1631498770?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1631498770", "isbn13": "9781631498770"}, {"isbn10": "1631498789", "isbn13": "9781631498787"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1631498770?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781631498770?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781631498770"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTRUST%2FPete%2BButtigieg%2F9781631498770"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781631498770"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781631498770?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/bdb8ee73-ac98-5499-b076-f3aaa3f5d981", "list_date": "2020/10/25", "published_data": "2020-10-06", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER In Trust, Pete Buttigieg demonstrates how trust will be essential in order to face the unique challenges of the decades ahead. Trust is essential to the foundation of America\u2019s democracy, asserts Pete Buttigieg, the former presidential candidate and South Bend mayor. Yet, in a century warped by terrorism, financial collapse, Trumpist populism, systemic racism, and now a global pandemic, trust has been squandered, sacrificed, abused, stolen, or never properly built in the first place. And now, more so than ever before, Americans must work side by side to reckon with the monumental challenges posed by our present moment. Interweaving history, political philosophy, and affecting passages of memoir, Buttigieg explores the strong relationship between measures of prosperity and levels of social trust. He provides an impassioned account of a threefold crisis of trust: in our institutions, in each other, and in the American project itself. Today, these perilous patterns of distrust have wreaked havoc on nearly every sector of society, as Americans increasingly resent the very government that needs to be part of the solution. With the internet and partisan television networks acting as accelerants, Americans jettison any sense of shared reality, lose confidence in experts and scientists, and cope with the grim national tragedy of a pandemic that has only further exemplified the lethality of distrust. Buttigieg contends that our success, or failure, at confronting the greatest challenges of the decade\u2014racial and economic justice, pandemic resilience, and climate action\u2014will rest on whether we can effectively cultivate, deepen, and, where necessary, repair the networks of trust that are now endangered, or for so many, have never even existed. An urgent call to foster an \u201cAmerican way of trust\u201d at this painfully polarized juncture in the nation\u2019s history, Trust is a direct reckoning with the prevailing corruption of social responsibility. Yet refusing to give in to the despair that threatens our foundations, Trust seeks to inspire Americans to build a powerful movement that will define all of us in the years to come."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1250113083", "primary_isbn13": "9781250113085", "publisher": "Holt", "description": "The musician reflects on how opposing elements created balance in his life.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Let Love Rule", "author": "Lenny Kravitz with David Ritz", "contributor": "by Lenny Kravitz with David Ritz", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781250113085.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250113083?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1250113083", "isbn13": "9781250113085"}, {"isbn10": "1250113091", "isbn13": "9781250113092"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250113083?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781250113085?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781250113085"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FLET%2BLOVE%2BRULE%2FLenny%2BKravitz%2Bwith%2BDavid%2BRitz%2F9781250113085"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781250113085"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250113085?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/3fdd753f-1fc5-51c0-ad61-ec4dc8064ca1", "list_date": "2020/10/25", "published_data": "2020-10-06", "summary": "\u201cI see my story as a suite of songs that have a magical connection.

It\u2019s the story of a wildly creative kid who, despite tough struggles at school and extreme tension at home, finds salvation in music. We see him grow as a musician and ultimately a master songwriter, producer, and performer. We also see Lenny\u2019s spiritual growth\u2014and the powerful way in which spirit informs his music. The cast of characters surrounding Lenny is extraordinary: his father, Sy, a high-powered news executive; his mother, Roxie Roker, a television star; and Lisa Bonet, the young actress who becomes his muse. The central character, of course, is Lenny, who, despite his great aspirational energy, turns down record deal after record deal until he finds his true voice.

Baker III: the man who ran Washington when Washington ran the world. For a quarter-century, from the end of Watergate to the aftermath of the Cold War, no Republican won the presidency without his help or ran the White House without his advice. James Addison Baker III was the indispensable man for four presidents because he understood better than anyone how to make Washington work at a time when America was shaping events around the world. The Man Who Ran Washington is a page-turning portrait of a power broker who influenced America's destiny for generations. A scion of Texas aristocracy who became George H. W. Bush's best friend on the tennis courts of the Houston Country Club, Baker had never even worked in Washington until a devastating family tragedy struck when he was thirty-nine. Within a few years, he was leading Gerald Ford's campaign and would go on to manage a total of five presidential races and win a sixth for George W. Bush in a Florida recount. He ran Ronald Reagan's White House and became the most consequential secretary of state since Henry Kissinger. He negotiated with Democrats at home and Soviets abroad, rewrote the tax code, assembled the coalition that won the Gulf War, brokered the reunification of Germany and helped bring a decades-long nuclear superpower standoff to an end. Ruthlessly partisan during campaign season, Baker governed as the avatar of pragmatism over purity and deal-making over division, a lost art in today's fractured nation. His story is a case study in the acquisition, exercise, and preservation of power in late twentieth-century America and the story of Washington and the world in the modern era--how it once worked and how it has transformed into an era of gridlock and polarization. This masterly biography by two brilliant observers of the American political scene is destined to become a classic."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 11, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1982141468", "primary_isbn13": "9781982141462", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "description": "The clinical psychologist gives her assessment of events and patterns inside her family and how they shaped President Trump.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Too Much And Never Enough", "author": "Mary L Trump", "contributor": "by Mary L.

Trump and the toxic family that made him, Mary L. Trump, a trained clinical psychologist and Donald\u2019s only niece, shines a bright light on the dark history of their family in order to explain how her uncle became the man who now threatens the world\u2019s health, economic security, and social fabric. Mary Trump spent much of her childhood in her grandparents\u2019 large, imposing house in the heart of Queens, New York, where Donald and his four siblings grew up. She describes a nightmare of traumas, destructive relationships, and a tragic combination of neglect and abuse. She explains how specific events and general family patterns created the damaged man who currently occupies the Oval Office, including the strange and harmful relationship between Fred Trump and his two oldest sons, Fred Jr. and Donald. A firsthand witness to countless holiday meals and interactions, Mary brings an incisive wit and unexpected humor to sometimes grim, often confounding family events. She recounts in unsparing detail everything from her uncle Donald\u2019s place in the family spotlight and Ivana\u2019s penchant for regifting to her grandmother\u2019s frequent injuries and illnesses and the appalling way Donald, Fred Trump\u2019s favorite son, dismissed and derided him when he began to succumb to Alzheimer\u2019s. Numerous pundits, armchair psychologists, and journalists have sought to parse Donald J. Trump\u2019s lethal flaws. Mary L. Trump has the education, insight, and intimate familiarity needed to reveal what makes Donald, and the rest of her clan, tick. She alone can recount this fascinating, unnerving saga, not just because of her insider\u2019s perspective but also because she is the only Trump willing to tell the truth about one of the world\u2019s most powerful and dysfunctional families."}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 4, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0062415832", "primary_isbn13": "9780062415837", "publisher": "Dey Street", "description": "A celebration of the life and career of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Notorious Rbg", "author": "Irin Carmon and Shana Knizhnik", "contributor": "by Irin Carmon and Shana Knizhnik", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780062415837.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 431, "amazon_product_url": "http://www.amazon.com/Notorious-RBG-Times-Bader-Ginsburg/dp/0062415832?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0062415832", "isbn13": "9780062415837"}, {"isbn10": "0062415824", "isbn13": "9780062415820"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "http://www.amazon.com/Notorious-RBG-Times-Bader-Ginsburg/dp/0062415832?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780062415837?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780062415837"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FNOTORIOUS%2BRBG%2FIrin%2BCarmon%2Band%2BShana%2BKnizhnik%2F9780062415837"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780062415837"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062415837?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/b890f720-7bc5-581d-934c-b67dac844bd6", "list_date": "2020/10/11", "published_data": "2015-10-27", "summary": "You can't spell truth without Ruth.

America is great for a reason. Built on principles of freedom, rugged individualism, and self-sufficiency, no country has ever accumulated more power and wealth, abused it less, or used that power more to advance the human condition. And yet, as America blossomed, leftwing radicalism and resentment festered beneath the surface, threatening to undermine democracy first in the sixties and now\u2014more insidiously than ever\u2014in the form of social justice warriors, the deep state, and compromised institutions like academia and the mainstream media. Our fate if we succumb to a Democratic victory in 2020? A big step toward full-blown socialism along with the economic dysfunction and social strife that are its hallmarks. With radical Democrats demanding the Green New Deal, socialized medicine, abortion on demand, open borders, abolishing the Electoral College, packing the Supreme Court, and an end to free speech, our great nation will be fundamentally transformed beyond recognition. Ronald Reagan once said, \u201cFreedom is but one generation away from extinction,\u201d and his words have never rung truer. In Live Free or Die, Sean demonstrates why now is an All Hands on Deck moment to save the Republic. His solution is simple: if all you can do is vote, then vote.

General H.R. McMaster, U.S. Army, ret., the former National Security Advisor and author of the bestselling classic Dereliction of Duty, comes a bold and provocative re-examination of the most critical foreign policy and national security challenges that face the United States, and an urgent call to compete to preserve America's standing and security. Across multiple administrations since the end of the Cold War, American foreign policy has been misconceived, inconsistent, and poorly implemented. As a result, America and the free world have fallen behind rivals in power and influence. Meanwhile threats to security, freedom, and prosperity, such as nuclear proliferation and jihadist terrorism have grown. In BATTLEGROUNDS, H.R. McMaster describes efforts to reassess and fundamentally shift policies while he was National Security Advisor. And he provides a clear pathway forward to improve strategic competence and prevail in complex competitions against our adversaries. BATTLEGROUNDS is a groundbreaking reassessment of America's place in the world, drawing from McMaster's long engagement with these issues, including 34 years of service in the U.S. Army with multiple tours of duty in battlegrounds overseas and his 13 months as National Security Advisor in the Trump White House. It is also a powerful call for Americans and citizens of the free world to transcend the vitriol of partisan political discourse, better educate themselves about the most significant challenges to national and international security and work together to secure peace and prosperity for future generations."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0525512330", "primary_isbn13": "9780525512332", "publisher": "Random House", "description": "The hosts of the late-night show \u201cDesus & Mero\u201d and the \u201cBodega Boys\u201d podcast impart wisdom they learned living in the Bronx.", "price": "0.00", "title": "God-Level Knowledge Darts", "author": "Desus Nice and the Kid Mero", "contributor": "by Desus Nice and the Kid Mero", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780525512332.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525512330?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0525512330", "isbn13": "9780525512332"}, {"isbn10": "0525512349", "isbn13": "9780525512349"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525512330?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780525512332?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780525512332"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FGOD-LEVEL%2BKNOWLEDGE%2BDARTS%2FDesus%2BNice%2Band%2Bthe%2BKid%2BMero%2F9780525512332"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780525512332"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780525512332?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/49c423d1-ff55-59bc-8bb9-1adb7cb1688d", "list_date": "2020/10/11", "published_data": "2020-09-22", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 \u201cDesus & Mero are smarter and funnier than everyone writing books.\u201d\u2014Shea Serrano \u201cI will never write anything as hilarious as they have.

As their friendship deepened over lunches at Manhattan hot spots, black-tie parties, and giggle sessions in the penthouse at Trump Tower, Wolkoff watched the newest Mrs. Trump raise her son, Barron, and manage her highly scrutinized marriage. After Trump won the 2016 election, Wolkoff was recruited to help produce the 58th Presidential Inaugu\u00adration and to become the First Lady\u2019s trusted advisor. Melania put Wolkoff in charge of hiring her staff, organizing her events, helping her write speeches, and creating her debut initiatives. Then it all fell apart when she was made the scapegoat for inauguration finance irregularities. Melania could have defended her innocent friend and confidant, but she stood by her man, knowing full well who was really to blame. The betrayal nearly destroyed Wolkoff. In this candid and emotional memoir, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff takes you into Trump Tower and the White House to tell the funny, thrilling, and heartbreaking story of her intimate friendship with one of the most famous women in the world, a woman few people truly understand. How did Melania react to the Access Hollywood tape and her husband\u2019s affair with Stormy Daniels? Does she get along well with Ivanka? Why did she wear that jacket with \u201cI really don\u2019t care, do u?\u201d printed on the back? Is Melania happy being First Lady?

Perfectly positioned to bridge the gap between people of color and white Americans struggling with race complexities, Oluo answers the questions readers don't dare ask, and explains the concepts that continue to elude everyday Americans. Oluo is an exceptional writer with a rare ability to be straightforward, funny, and effective in her coverage of sensitive, hyper-charged issues in America. Her messages are passionate but finely tuned and crystalize ideas that would otherwise be vague by empowering them with aha-moment clarity. Her writing brings to mind voices like Ta-Nehisi Coates, Roxane Gay, Jessica Valenti in Full Frontal Feminism, and a young Gloria Naylor, particularly in Naylor's seminal essay \"The Meaning of a Word.\""}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 11, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1982142448", "primary_isbn13": "9781982142445", "publisher": "One Signal/Atria", "description": "The CNN anchor and chief media correspondent examines the inner workings of Fox News and its relationship with President Trump.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Hoax", "author": "Brian Stelter", "contributor": "by Brian Stelter", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781982142445.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982142448?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1982142448", "isbn13": "9781982142445"}, {"isbn10": "1982142464", "isbn13": "9781982142469"}, {"isbn10": "1797117246", "isbn13": "9781797117249"}, {"isbn10": "1982142456", "isbn13": "9781982142452"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982142448?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781982142445?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781982142445"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FHOAX%2FBrian%2BStelter%2F9781982142445"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781982142445"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781982142445?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/04eca622-6f41-5a7f-98ea-436bf2b6a74b", "list_date": "2020/09/27", "published_data": "2020-08-25", "summary": "INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER An NPR Best Book of the Year \u201cA thorough and damning exploration of the incestuous relationship between Trump and his favorite channel.\u201d \u2014The New York Times \u201cA Rosetta Stone for stuff about this presidency that doesn\u2019t otherwise make sense to normal humans.\u201d \u2014Rachel Maddow, MSNBC \u201cStelter\u2019s critique goes beyond salacious tidbits about extramarital affairs (though there are plenty of those) to expose a collusion that threatens the pillars of our democracy.\u201d \u2014The Washington Post The urgent and untold story of the collusion between Fox News and Donald Trump from the New York Times bestselling author of Top of the Morning. While other leaders were marshaling resources to combat the greatest pandemic in modern history, President Donald Trump was watching TV. Trump watches over six hours of Fox News a day, a habit his staff refers to as \u201cexecutive time.\u201d In January 2020, when Fox News began to downplay COVID-19, the President was quick to agree. In March, as the deadly virus spiraled out of control, Sean Hannity mocked \u201ccoronavirus hysteria\u201d as a \u201cnew hoax\u201d from the left. Millions of Americans took Hannity and Trump's words as truth\u2014until some of them started to get sick. In Hoax, CNN anchor and chief media correspondent Brian Stelter tells the twisted story of the relationship between Donald Trump and Fox News. From the moment Trump glided down the golden escalator to announce his candidacy in the 2016 presidential election to his acquittal on two articles of impeachment in early 2020, Fox hosts spread his lies and smeared his enemies. Over the course of two years, Stelter spoke with over 250 current and former Fox insiders in an effort to understand the inner workings of Rupert Murdoch's multibillion-dollar media empire. Some of the confessions are alarming. \u201cWe don't really believe all this stuff,\u201d a producer says. \u201cWe just tell other people to believe it.\u201d At the center of the story lies Sean Hannity, a college dropout who, following the death of Fox News mastermind Roger Ailes, reigns supreme at the network that pays him $30 million a year. Stelter describes the raging tensions inside Fox between the Trump loyalists and the few remaining journalists.

ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: NPR, Fortune, Parade, The New York Public Library, Garden & Gun In 2004, Momofuku Noodle Bar opened in a tiny, stark space in Manhattan\u2019s East Village. Its young chef-owner, David Chang, worked the line, serving ramen and pork buns to a mix of fellow restaurant cooks and confused diners whose idea of ramen was instant noodles in Styrofoam cups. It would have been impossible to know it at the time\u2014and certainly Chang would have bet against himself\u2014but he, who had failed at almost every endeavor in his life, was about to become one of the most influential chefs of his generation, driven by the question, \u201cWhat if the underground could become the mainstream?\u201d Chang grew up the youngest son of a deeply religious Korean American family in Virginia. Graduating college aimless and depressed, he fled the States for Japan, hoping to find some sense of belonging. While teaching English in a backwater town, he experienced the highs of his first full-blown manic episode, and began to think that the cooking and sharing of food could give him both purpose and agency in his life. Full of grace, candor, grit, and humor, Eat a Peach chronicles Chang\u2019s switchback path. He lays bare his mistakes and wonders about his extraordinary luck as he recounts the improbable series of events that led him to the top of his profession. He wrestles with his lifelong feelings of otherness and inadequacy, explores the mental illness that almost killed him, and finds hope in the shared value of deliciousness. Along the way, Chang gives us a penetrating look at restaurant life, in which he balances his deep love for the kitchen with unflinching honesty about the industry\u2019s history of brutishness and its uncertain future."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 3, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1984854666", "primary_isbn13": "9781984854667", "publisher": "Random House", "description": "The New York Times Washington correspondent details actions by officials who attempted to contain the president.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Donald Trump V.

Toll, \u201cone of the great storytellers of War\u201d (Evan Thomas). In June 1944, the United States launched a crushing assault on the Japanese navy in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. The capture of the Mariana Islands and the accompanying ruin of Japanese carrier airpower marked a pivotal moment in the Pacific War. No tactical masterstroke or blunder could reverse the increasingly lopsided balance of power between the two combatants. The War in the Pacific had entered its endgame. Beginning with the Honolulu Conference, when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt met with his Pacific theater commanders to plan the last phase of the campaign against Japan, Twilight of the Gods brings to life the harrowing last year of World War II in the Pacific, when the U.S. Navy won the largest naval battle in history; Douglas MacArthur made good his pledge to return to the Philippines; waves of kamikazes attacked the Allied fleets; the Japanese fought to the last man on one island after another; B-29 bombers burned down Japanese cities; and Hiroshima and Nagasaki were vaporized in atomic blasts. Ian W. Toll\u2019s narratives of combat in the air, at sea, and on the beaches are as gripping as ever, but he also reconstructs the Japanese and American home fronts and takes the reader into the halls of power in Washington and Tokyo, where the great questions of strategy and diplomacy were decided. Drawing from a wealth of rich archival sources and new material, Twilight of the Gods casts a penetrating light on the battles, grand strategic decisions and naval logistics that enabled the Allied victory in the Pacific. An authoritative and riveting account of the final phase of the War in the Pacific, Twilight of the Gods brings Toll\u2019s masterful trilogy to a thrilling conclusion. This prize-winning and best-selling trilogy will stand as the first complete history of the Pacific War in more than twenty-five years, and the first multivolume history of the Pacific naval war since Samuel Eliot Morison\u2019s series was published in the 1950s."}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 1, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1984855026", "primary_isbn13": "9781984855022", "publisher": "Random House", "description": "The Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer creates a portrait of Representative John Lewis, the late civil rights leader and congressman for Georgia\u2019s Fifth Congressional District.", "price": "0.00", "title": "His Truth Is Marching On", "author": "Jon Meacham", "contributor": "by Jon Meacham", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781984855022.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1984855026?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1984855026", "isbn13": "9781984855022"}, {"isbn10": "0593241819", "isbn13": "9780593241813"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1984855026?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781984855022?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781984855022"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FHIS%2BTRUTH%2BIS%2BMARCHING%2BON%2FJon%2BMeacham%2F9781984855022"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781984855022"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781984855022?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/6f63f7f6-a537-5976-8277-71c38d13aa24", "list_date": "2020/09/20", "published_data": "2020-08-25", "summary": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 An intimate and revealing portrait of civil rights icon and longtime U.S. congressman John Lewis, linking his life to the painful quest for justice in America from the 1950s to the present\u2014from the Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning author of The Soul of America NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY THE WASHINGTON POST AND COSMOPOLITAN John Lewis, who at age twenty-five marched in Selma, Alabama, and was beaten on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, was a visionary and a man of faith. Drawing on decades of wide-ranging interviews with Lewis, Jon Meacham writes of how this great-grandson of a slave and son of an Alabama tenant farmer was inspired by the Bible and his teachers in nonviolence, Reverend James Lawson and Martin Luther King, Jr., to put his life on the line in the service of what Abraham Lincoln called \u201cthe better angels of our nature.\u201d From an early age, Lewis learned that nonviolence was not only a tactic but a philosophy, a biblical imperative, and a transforming reality. At the age of four, Lewis, ambitious to become a minister, practiced by preaching to his family\u2019s chickens. When his mother cooked one of the chickens, the boy refused to eat it\u2014his first act, he wryly recalled, of nonviolent protest. Integral to Lewis\u2019s commitment to bettering the nation was his faith in humanity and in God\u2014and an unshakable belief in the power of hope. Meacham calls Lewis \u201cas important to the founding of a modern and multiethnic twentieth- and twenty-first-century America as Thomas Jefferson and James Madison and Samuel Adams were to the initial creation of the Republic itself in the eighteenth century.\u201d A believer in the injunction that one should love one's neighbor as oneself, Lewis was arguably a saint in our time, risking limb and life to bear witness for the powerless in the face of the powerful. In many ways he brought a still-evolving nation closer to realizing its ideals, and his story offers inspiration and illumination for Americans today who are working for social and political change."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1982134100", "primary_isbn13": "9781982134105", "publisher": "Avid Reader/Simon & Schuster", "description": "The history of the New England Patriots from N.F.L. laughingstock to making 10 trips to the Super Bowl.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Dynasty", "author": "Jeff Benedict", "contributor": "by Jeff Benedict", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781982134105.jpg", "book_image_width": 327, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982134100?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1982134100", "isbn13": "9781982134105"}, {"isbn10": "1982134127", "isbn13": "9781982134129"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982134100?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781982134105?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781982134105"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BDYNASTY%2FJeff%2BBenedict%2F9781982134105"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781982134105"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781982134105?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/6ac5dfc1-0dbf-500f-8249-748b1f6933bb", "list_date": "2020/09/20", "published_data": "2020-09-01", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER From the #1 New York Times bestselling coauthor of Tiger Woods comes the definitive inside story of the New England Patriots\u2014the greatest sports dynasty of the 21st century. It\u2019s easy to forget that the New England Patriots were once the laughingstock of the NFL, a nearly bankrupt team that had never won a championship and was on the brink of moving to St. Louis. Everything changed in 1994, when Robert Kraft acquired the franchise and soon brought on board head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady. Since then, the Patriots have become a juggernaut, making ten trips to the Super Bowl, winning six of them, and emerging as one of the most valuable sports franchises in the world. Today, the team\u2019s twenty-year reign atop the NFL stands as the longest in league history. How was the Patriots dynasty built? And how did it last for two decades? In The Dynasty, acclaimed journalist Jeff Benedict provides richly reported answers in a sweeping account based on exclusive interviews with more than two hundred insiders\u2014including team executives, coaches, players, players\u2019 wives, team doctors, lawyers, and more\u2014as well as never-before-seen recordings, documents, and electronic communications. Through his exhaustive research, Benedict uncovers surprising new details about the inner workings of a team notorious for its secrecy. He puts readers in the room as Robert Kraft outmaneuvers a legion of lawyers and investors to buy the team. We listen in on the phone call when the greatest trade ever made\u2014Bill Belichick for a first-round draft choice\u2014is negotiated. And we look over the shoulder of forty-year-old Tom Brady as a surgeon operates on his throwing hand on the eve of the AFC Championship Game in 2018. But the portrait that emerges in The Dynasty is more rewarding than new details alone. By tracing the team\u2019s epic run through the perspectives of Kraft, Belichick, and Brady\u2014each of whom was interviewed for the book\u2014the author provides a wealth of new insight into the complex human beings most responsible for the Patriots\u2019 success. We watch the NFL\u2019s savviest owner treat Brady like a son, empower Belichick to cut and trade beloved players, and spend sleepless nights figuring out diplomatic ways to keep Brady and Belichick together for two decades. We come to understand how a genius head coach keeps his players at an emotional distance and blocks out anything that gets in the way of winning. And we experience the relentless drive, ferocious competitive nature, and emotional sensitivity that allows Brady to continue playing football into his forties. The result is an intimate portrait that captures the human drama of the dynasty\u2019s three key characters while also revealing the secrets behind their success. This is perhaps the most compelling and illuminating book that will ever be written about the greatest professional sports team of our time."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1982138122", "primary_isbn13": "9781982138127", "publisher": "Atria", "description": "The educator and advocate describes growing up gay in a small Midwestern town and meeting his husband, Pete.", "price": "0.00", "title": "I Have Something To Tell You", "author": "Chasten Buttigieg", "contributor": "by Chasten Buttigieg", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781982138127.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982138122?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1982138122", "isbn13": "9781982138127"}, {"isbn10": "1982138149", "isbn13": "9781982138141"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982138122?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781982138127?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781982138127"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FI%2BHAVE%2BSOMETHING%2BTO%2BTELL%2BYOU%2FChasten%2BButtigieg%2F9781982138127"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781982138127"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781982138127?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/15c22ff2-8316-5968-bb15-31d2cec26de8", "list_date": "2020/09/20", "published_data": "2020-09-01", "summary": "INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER A moving, hopeful, and refreshingly candid memoir by the husband of former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg about growing up gay in his small Midwestern town, his relationship with Pete, and his hope for America\u2019s future. Throughout the past year, teacher Chasten Glezman Buttigieg has emerged on the national stage, having left his classroom in South Bend, Indiana, to travel cross-country in support of his husband, former mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Pete\u2019s groundbreaking presidential campaign. Through Chasten\u2019s joyful, witty social media posts, the public gained a behind-the-scenes look at his life with Pete on the trail\u2014moments that might have ranged from the mundane to the surprising, but that were always heartfelt. Chasten has overcome a multitude of obstacles to get here. In this moving, uplifting memoir, he recounts his journey to finding acceptance as a gay man. He recalls his upbringing in rural Michigan, where he knew he was different, where indeed he felt different from his father and brothers.

NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY PARADE When country music star Thomas Rhett won the ACM Award for Single of the Year with \u201cDie a Happy Man,\u201d his wife, Lauren Akins, was overjoyed. Her childhood best friend and now husband was being anointed the hottest new star in country music\u2014for a song he had written about her. He was living his dream. Lauren was elated, but she was also wrestling with some big questions, not the least of which was, How can I live my own life of purpose? Lauren Akins never wanted to be in the spotlight, but as Thomas Rhett made his relationship with Lauren the subject of many of his hit songs, she was tossed into the role of one of America\u2019s sweethearts. Revered by fans for her down-to-earth ease and charm, her commitment to humanitarian work, and the pure love she exudes for her family, Lauren has never shared her side of their story\u2014full as it\u2019s been with deep love, painful loss, tremendous joy, and a struggle to stay grounded in faith along the way\u2014until now. In Live in Love, Lauren shares details about her childhood friendship with Thomas Rhett, explaining how they reconnected as young adults. She offers a rare behind-the-scenes look at the challenges of being married to her best friend, who just happens to be a music star, and the struggle to find her own footing in the frenzy of her husband\u2019s fame. And in heart-wrenching detail, she opens up about her life-changing experiences doing mission work in Haiti, and then in Uganda, where she met the precious baby who would become their first daughter. From sharing the romance of their handwritten wedding vows to the challenges they faced as they adjusted to the reality of becoming first-time parents, Live in Love takes an intimate look at one couple\u2019s life\u2014and opens a window into all of our journeys on the path to self-discovery.

This reckoning inspired Stevens to publish this blistering, tell-all history... Although this book will be a hard read for any committed conservatives, they would do well to ponder it.\" --Julian E. Zelizer, The New York Times From the most successful Republican political operative of his generation, a searing, unflinching, and deeply personal expos\u00e9 of how his party became what it is today Stuart Stevens spent decades electing Republicans at every level, from presidents to senators to local officials. He knows the GOP as intimately as anyone in America, and in this new book he offers a devastating portrait of a party that has lost its moral and political compass. This is not a book about how Donald J. Trump hijacked the Republican Party and changed it into something else. Stevens shows how Trump is in fact the natural outcome of five decades of hypocrisy and self-delusion, dating all the way back to the civil rights legislation of the early 1960s. Stevens shows how racism has always lurked in the modern GOP's DNA, from Goldwater's opposition to desegregation to Ronald Reagan's welfare queens and states' rights rhetoric. He gives an insider's account of the rank hypocrisy of the party's claims to embody \"family values,\" and shows how the party's vaunted commitment to fiscal responsibility has been a charade since the 1980s. When a party stands for nothing, he argues, it is only natural that it will be taken over by the loudest and angriest voices in the room. It Was All a Lie is not just an indictment of the Republican Party, but a candid and often lacerating mea culpa. Stevens is not asking for pity or forgiveness; he is simply telling us what he has seen firsthand. He helped to create the modern party that kneels before a morally bankrupt con man and now he wants nothing more than to see what it has become burned to the ground."}, {"rank": 6, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0358048001", "primary_isbn13": "9780358048008", "publisher": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", "description": "A look at how social movements evolve and ways in which activists can sustain their efforts.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Make Change", "author": "Shaun King", "contributor": "by Shaun King", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780358048008.jpg", "book_image_width": 336, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0358048001?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0358048001", "isbn13": "9780358048008"}, {"isbn10": "035804801X", "isbn13": "9780358048015"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0358048001?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780358048008?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780358048008"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FMAKE%2BCHANGE%2FShaun%2BKing%2F9780358048008"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780358048008"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780358048008?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/a84964f8-d545-5585-aaf2-5506383b08c8", "list_date": "2020/08/23", "published_data": "2020", "summary": "Activist and journalist Shaun King reflects on the events that made him one of the most prominent social justice leaders of our time and lays out a clear action plan for you to join the fight--with a foreword from Bernie Sanders"}, {"rank": 9, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0385536739", "primary_isbn13": "9780385536738", "publisher": "Doubleday", "description": "The CNN chief legal analyst weaves a narrative of the Mueller investigation, President Trump\u2019s impeachment and transgressions by key Trump figures.", "price": "0.00", "title": "True Crimes And Misdemeanors", "author": "Jeffrey Toobin", "contributor": "by Jeffrey Toobin", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780385536738.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385536739?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0385536739", "isbn13": "9780385536738"}, {"isbn10": "0385546912", "isbn13": "9780385546911"}, {"isbn10": "0385536747", "isbn13": "9780385536745"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385536739?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780385536738?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780385536738"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTRUE%2BCRIMES%2BAND%2BMISDEMEANORS%2FJeffrey%2BToobin%2F9780385536738"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780385536738"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780385536738?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/935ec53f-42fd-555f-876d-bd006f59d552", "list_date": "2020/08/23", "published_data": "2020-08-04", "summary": "From CNN chief legal analyst and bestselling author Jeffrey Toobin, a real-life legal thriller about the prosecutors and congressional investigators pursuing the truth about Donald Trump's complicity in several crimes--and why they failed. Donald Trump's campaign chairman went to jail. So did his personal lawyer. His long-time political consigliere was convicted of serious federal crimes, and his national security advisor pled guilty to others. Several Russian spies were indicted in absentia. Career intelligence agents and military officers were alarmed enough by the president's actions that they alerted senior government officials and ignited the impeachment process. Yet despite all this, a years-long inquiry led by special counsel Robert Mueller, and the third impeachment of a president in American history, Donald Trump survived to run for re-election. Why? Jeffrey Toobin's highly entertaining definitive account of the Mueller investigation and the impeachment of the president takes readers behind the scenes of the epic legal and political struggle to call Trump to account for his misdeeds. With his superb storytelling and analytic skills Toobin recounts all the mind-boggling twists and turns in the case--Trump's son met with a Russian operative promising Kremlin support! Trump paid a porn star $130,000 to hush up an affair! Rudy Giuliani and a pair of shady Ukrainian-American businessmen got the Justice Department to look at Russian-created conspiracy theories! Toobin shows how Trump's canny lawyers used Mueller's famous integrity against him, and how Trump's bullying and bluster cowed Republican legislators into ignoring the clear evidence of the impeachment hearings. Based on dozens of interviews with prosecutors in Mueller's office, Trump's legal team, Congressional investigators, White House staffers, and several of the key players, including some who are now in prison, True Crimes and Misdemeanors is a revelatory narrative that makes sense of the seemingly endless chaos of the Trump years. Filled with never-before-reported details of the high-stakes legal battles and political machinations, the book weaves a tale of a rogue president guilty of historic misconduct, and how he got away with it."}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 8, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1620971933", "primary_isbn13": "9781620971932", "publisher": "New Press", "description": "A law professor takes aim at the \u201cwar on drugs,\u201d mass incarceration and their impact on Black men.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The New Jim Crow", "author": "Michelle Alexander", "contributor": "by Michelle Alexander", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781595586438.jpg", "book_image_width": 128, "book_image_height": 191, "amazon_product_url": "http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Crow-Incarceration-Colorblindness/dp/1595586431?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1595586431", "isbn13": "9781595586438"}, {"isbn10": "1595581030", "isbn13": "9781595581037"}, {"isbn10": "1595588191", "isbn13": "9781595588197"}, {"isbn10": "1595585303", "isbn13": "9781595585301"}, {"isbn10": "1501260235", "isbn13": "9781501260230"}, {"isbn10": "1620971933", "isbn13": "9781620971932"}, {"isbn10": "1620975459", "isbn13": "9781620975459"}, {"isbn10": "1464048258", "isbn13": "9781464048258"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Crow-Incarceration-Colorblindness/dp/1595586431?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781620971932?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781620971932"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BNEW%2BJIM%2BCROW%2FMichelle%2BAlexander%2F9781620971932"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781620971932"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781620971932?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/c719d17c-b66d-54e1-849b-78bcab895363", "list_date": "2020/08/23", "published_data": "2020-01-07", "summary": "A tenth-anniversary edition of the iconic bestseller--\"one of the most influential books of the past 20 years,\" according to the Chronicle of Higher Education--with a new preface by the author Seldom does a book have the impact of Michelle Alexander's The New Jim Crow.

Elegantly written and urgently argued, Twilight of Democracy is a brilliant dissection of a world-shaking shift and a stirring glimpse of the road back to democratic values."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1476797714", "primary_isbn13": "9781476797717", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "description": "A memoir by the recently deceased leader in the American civil rights movement and representative for Georgia\u2019s Fifth Congressional District.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Walking With The Wind", "author": "John Lewis and Michael D'Orso", "contributor": "by John Lewis and Michael D'Orso", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781476797717.jpg", "book_image_width": 333, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1476797714?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1476797714", "isbn13": "9781476797717"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1476797714?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781476797717?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781476797717"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FWALKING%2BWITH%2BTHE%2BWIND%2FJohn%2BLewis%2Band%2BMichael%2BD%2527Orso%2F9781476797717"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781476797717"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781476797717?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/5e31812e-0c09-54ff-9fa7-5be087bf6ab8", "list_date": "2020/08/09", "published_data": "2015-02-10", "summary": "The award-winning national bestseller, Walking with the Wind, is one of the most important records of the American civil rights movement as told by a true American hero, John Lewis, who Cornel West called a \u201cnational treasure.\u201d An eloquent and gripping first-hand account of the turbulent struggle for civil rights and the willingness and courage to change the course of history. Forty years ago, a teenaged boy named John Lewis stepped off a cotton farm in Alabama and into the epicenter of the struggle for civil rights in America. The ideals of nonviolence which guided that critical time of American history established him as one of the movement's most charismatic and courageous leaders. Lewis's leadership in the Nashville Movement\u2014a student-led effort to desegregate the city of Nashville using sit-in techniques based on the teachings of Gandhi\u2014established him as one of the movement's defining figures and set the tone for the major civil rights campaigns of the 1960s. During this decade, he was repeatedly a victim of violence and intimidation, but his singular belief in non-violent action, inspired by his mentor, Dr. Martin Luther King, was a defining characteristic of his leadership and vision. In 1986, he ran and won a congressional seat in Georgia, and remains in office to this day. Walking with the Wind is the story of an American hero. A boy from rural Alabama whose journey led him to Washington, and whose vision and perseverance changed a nation."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 15, "weeks_on_list": 8, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1568585985", "primary_isbn13": "9781568585987", "publisher": "Bold Type", "description": "Winner of the 2016 National Book Award for nonfiction.

In fact, racist thought is alive and well in America--more sophisticated and more insidious than ever. And as award-winning historian Ibram X. Kendi argues in Stamped from the Beginning, if we have any hope of grappling with this stark reality, we must first understand how racist ideas were developed, disseminated, and enshrined in American society. In this deeply researched and fast-moving narrative, Kendi chronicles the entire story of anti-black racist ideas and their staggering power over the course of American history. Stamped from the Beginning uses the life stories of five major American intellectuals to offer a window into the contentious debates between assimilationists and segregationists and between racists and antiracists. From Puritan minister Cotton Mather to Thomas Jefferson, from fiery abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison to brilliant scholar W.E.B. Du Bois to legendary anti-prison activist Angela Davis, Kendi shows how and why some of our leading pro-slavery and pro-civil rights thinkers have challenged or helped cement racist ideas in America. Contrary to popular conceptions, racist ideas did not arise from ignorance or hatred. Instead, they were devised and honed by some of the most brilliant minds of each era. These intellectuals used their brilliance to justify and rationalize deeply entrenched discriminatory policies and the nation's racial disparities in everything from wealth to health. And while racist ideas are easily produced and easily consumed, they can also be discredited. In shedding much-needed light on the murky history of racist ideas, Stamped from the Beginning offers us the tools we need to expose them--and in the process, gives us reason to hope."}, {"rank": 6, "rank_last_week": 4, "weeks_on_list": 64, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0143034758", "primary_isbn13": "9780143034759", "publisher": "Penguin", "description": "A biography of the first Treasury secretary.

Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Chernow presents a landmark biography of Alexander Hamilton, the Founding Father who galvanized, inspired, scandalized, and shaped the newborn nation. \"Grand-scale biography at its best\u2014thorough, insightful, consistently fair, and superbly written . . . A genuinely great book.\" \u2014David McCullough \u201cA robust full-length portrait, in my view the best ever written, of the most brilliant, charismatic and dangerous founder of them all.\" \u2014Joseph Ellis Few figures in American history have been more hotly debated or more grossly misunderstood than Alexander Hamilton. Chernow\u2019s biography gives Hamilton his due and sets the record straight, deftly illustrating that the political and economic greatness of today\u2019s America is the result of Hamilton\u2019s countless sacrifices to champion ideas that were often wildly disputed during his time. \u201cTo repudiate his legacy,\u201d Chernow writes, \u201cis, in many ways, to repudiate the modern world.\u201d Chernow here recounts Hamilton\u2019s turbulent life: an illegitimate, largely self-taught orphan from the Caribbean, he came out of nowhere to take America by storm, rising to become George Washington\u2019s aide-de-camp in the Continental Army, coauthoring The Federalist Papers, founding the Bank of New York, leading the Federalist Party, and becoming the first Treasury Secretary of the United States.Historians have long told the story of America\u2019s birth as the triumph of Jefferson\u2019s democratic ideals over the aristocratic intentions of Hamilton. Chernow presents an entirely different man, whose legendary ambitions were motivated not merely by self-interest but by passionate patriotism and a stubborn will to build the foundations of American prosperity and power. His is a Hamilton far more human than we\u2019ve encountered before\u2014from his shame about his birth to his fiery aspirations, from his intimate relationships with childhood friends to his titanic feuds with Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Monroe, and Burr, and from his highly public affair with Maria Reynolds to his loving marriage to his loyal wife Eliza. And never before has there been a more vivid account of Hamilton\u2019s famous and mysterious death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July of 1804. Chernow\u2019s biography is not just a portrait of Hamilton, but the story of America\u2019s birth seen through its most central figure. At a critical time to look back to our roots, Alexander Hamilton will remind readers of the purpose of our institutions and our heritage as Americans. 9780143034759"}, {"rank": 9, "rank_last_week": 8, "weeks_on_list": 7, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1631494538", "primary_isbn13": "9781631494536", "publisher": "Liveright", "description": "An examination of the ways in which the government caused residential segregation through racial zoning and other systemic practices.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Color Of Law", "author": "Richard Rothstein", "contributor": "by Richard Rothstein", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781631494536.jpg", "book_image_width": 314, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Color-Law-Forgotten-Government-Segregated/dp/1631494538?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1631494538", "isbn13": "9781631494536"}, {"isbn10": "1631492861", "isbn13": "9781631492860"}, {"isbn10": "1631492853", "isbn13": "9781631492853"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Color-Law-Forgotten-Government-Segregated/dp/1631494538?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781631494536?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781631494536"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BCOLOR%2BOF%2BLAW%2FRichard%2BRothstein%2F9781631494536"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781631494536"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781631494536?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/a632609b-e727-5818-b4ae-2d2849209e73", "list_date": "2020/08/02", "published_data": "2018-05-01", "summary": "New York Times Bestseller \u2022 Notable Book of the Year \u2022 Editors' Choice Selection One of Bill Gates\u2019 \u201cAmazing Books\u201d of the Year Longlisted for the National Book Award This \u201cpowerful and disturbing history\u201d exposes how American governments deliberately imposed racial segregation on metropolitan areas nationwide (New York Times Book Review).

Post * \u201cThe most exciting book I\u2019ve read all year.\u201d \u2014Admiral William H. McRaven From Chris Wallace, the veteran journalist and anchor of Fox News Sunday, comes an electrifying behind-the-scenes account of the 116 days leading up to the American attack on Hiroshima. April 12, 1945: After years of bloody conflict in Europe and the Pacific, America is stunned by news of President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s death. In an instant, Vice President Harry Truman, who has been kept out of war planning and knows nothing of the top-secret Manhattan Project to develop the world\u2019s first atomic bomb, must assume command of a nation at war on multiple continents\u2014and confront one of the most consequential decisions in history. Countdown 1945 tells the gripping true story of the turbulent days, weeks, and months to follow, leading up to August 6, 1945, when Truman gives the order to drop the bomb on Hiroshima. In Countdown 1945, Chris Wallace, the veteran journalist and anchor of Fox News Sunday, takes readers inside the minds of the iconic and elusive figures who join the quest for the bomb, each for different reasons: the legendary Albert Einstein, who eventually calls his vocal support for the atomic bomb \u201cthe one great mistake in my life\u201d; lead researcher J. Robert \u201cOppie\u201d Oppenheimer and the Soviet spies who secretly infiltrate his team; the fiercely competitive pilots of the plane selected to drop the bomb; and many more. Perhaps most of all, Countdown 1945 is the story of an untested new president confronting a decision that he knows will change the world forever. Truman\u2019s journey during these 116 days is a story of high drama: from the shock of learning of the bomb\u2019s existence, to the conflicting advice he receives from generals like Dwight D. Eisenhower and George Marshall, to wrestling with the devastating carnage that will result if he gives the order to use America\u2019s first weapon of mass destruction. But Countdown 1945 is more than a book about the atomic bomb. It\u2019s also an unforgettable account of the lives of ordinary American and Japanese civilians in wartime\u2014from \u201cCalutron Girls\u201d like Ruth Sisson in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to ten-year-old Hiroshima resident Hideko Tamura, who survives the blast at ground zero but loses her mother and later immigrates to the United States, where she lives to this day\u2014as well as American soldiers fighting in the Pacific, waiting in fear for the order to launch a possible invasion of Japan. Told with vigor, intelligence, and humanity, Countdown 1945 is the definitive account of one of the most significant moments in history."}, {"rank": 7, "rank_last_week": 6, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0465060684", "primary_isbn13": "9780465060689", "publisher": "Basic", "description": "The president emerita of Spelman College examines whether self-segregation is a problem or a coping strategy.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Why Are All The Black Kids Sitting Together In The Cafeteria?", "author": "Beverly Daniel Tatum", "contributor": "by Beverly Daniel Tatum", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780465060689.jpg", "book_image_width": 333, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0465060684?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0465060684", "isbn13": "9780465060689"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0465060684?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780465060689?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780465060689"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FWHY%2BARE%2BALL%2BTHE%2BBLACK%2BKIDS%2BSITTING%2BTOGETHER%2BIN%2BTHE%2BCAFETERIA%253F%2FBeverly%2BDaniel%2BTatum%2F9780465060689"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780465060689"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780465060689?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/64e4805e-1f79-5a46-a676-336b3a20f474", "list_date": "2020/07/05", "published_data": "2017-09-05", "summary": "The classic, bestselling book on the psychology of racism-now fully revised and updated Walk into any racially mixed high school and you will see Black, White, and Latino youth clustered in their own groups.

And like many women who have trespassed into the world of men, she uncovered decades-old secrets that many would prefer to stay buried. From her doctoral thesis, which changed the treatment of HIV-AIDS, saving the lives of millions, including basketball great Magic Johnson, to her spectacular discovery of a new family of human retroviruses, and her latest research which points to a new golden age of health, Dr. Mikovits has always been on the leading edge of science. With the brilliant wit one might expect if Erin Brockovich had a doctorate in molecular biology, Dr. Mikovits has seen the best and worst of science. When she was part of the research community that turned HIV-AIDS from a fatal disease into a manageable one, she saw science at its best. But when her investigations questioned whether the use of animal tissue in medical research were unleashing devastating plagues of chronic diseases, such as autism and chronic fatigue syndrome, she saw science at its worst. If her suspicions are correct, we are looking at a complete realignment of scientific practices, including how we study and treat human disease.

The way to do that is to distort nothing, to put the best face on nothing, to try to manipulate no one. Lincoln said that first, and best. A leader must make whatever horror exists concrete.

Grant hits like a Mack truck of knowledge.\u201d \u2014Ta-Nehisi Coates, The Atlantic Pulitzer Prize winner Ron Chernow returns with a sweeping and dramatic portrait of one of our most compelling generals and presidents, Ulysses S. Grant. Ulysses S. Grant's life has typically been misunderstood. All too often he is caricatured as a chronic loser and an inept businessman, or as the triumphant but brutal Union general of the Civil War. But these stereotypes don't come close to capturing him, as Chernow shows in his masterful biography, the first to provide a complete understanding of the general and president whose fortunes rose and fell with dizzying speed and frequency. Before the Civil War, Grant was flailing. His business ventures had ended dismally, and despite distinguished service in the Mexican War he ended up resigning from the army in disgrace amid recurring accusations of drunkenness. But in war, Grant began to realize his remarkable potential, soaring through the ranks of the Union army, prevailing at the battle of Shiloh and in the Vicksburg campaign, and ultimately defeating the legendary Confederate general Robert E. Lee. Along the way, Grant endeared himself to President Lincoln and became his most trusted general and the strategic genius of the war effort. Grant\u2019s military fame translated into a two-term presidency, but one plagued by corruption scandals involving his closest staff members. More important, he sought freedom and justice for black Americans, working to crush the Ku Klux Klan and earning the admiration of Frederick Douglass, who called him \u201cthe vigilant, firm, impartial, and wise protector of my race.\u201d After his presidency, he was again brought low by a dashing young swindler on Wall Street, only to resuscitate his image by working with Mark Twain to publish his memoirs, which are recognized as a masterpiece of the genre. With lucidity, breadth, and meticulousness, Chernow finds the threads that bind these disparate stories together, shedding new light on the man whom Walt Whitman described as \u201cnothing heroic... and yet the greatest hero.\u201d Chernow\u2019s probing portrait of Grant's lifelong struggle with alcoholism transforms our understanding of the man at the deepest level. This is America's greatest biographer, bringing movingly to life one of our finest but most underappreciated presidents. The definitive biography, Grant is a grand synthesis of painstaking research and literary brilliance that makes sense of all sides of Grant's life, explaining how this simple Midwesterner could at once be so ordinary and so extraordinary.

Mikel Jollett was born into one of the country\u2019s most infamous cults, and subjected to a childhood filled with poverty, addiction, and emotional abuse. Yet, ultimately, his is a story of fierce love and family loyalty told in a raw, poetic voice that signals the emergence of a uniquely gifted writer. We were never young. We were just too afraid of ourselves. No one told us who we were or what we were or where all our parents went. They would arrive like ghosts, visiting us for a morning, an afternoon. They would sit with us or walk around the grounds, to laugh or cry or toss us in the air while we screamed. Then they\u2019d disappear again, for weeks, for months, for years, leaving us alone with our memories and dreams, our questions and confusion. ... So begins Hollywood Park, Mikel Jollett\u2019s remarkable memoir. His story opens in an experimental commune in California, which later morphed into the Church of Synanon, one of the country\u2019s most infamous and dangerous cults. Per the leader\u2019s mandate, all children, including Jollett and his older brother, were separated from their parents when they were six months old, and handed over to the cult\u2019s \u201cSchool.\u201d After spending years in what was essentially an orphanage, Mikel escaped the cult one morning with his mother and older brother. But in many ways, life outside Synanon was even harder and more erratic. In his raw, poetic and powerful voice, Jollett portrays a childhood filled with abject poverty, trauma, emotional abuse, delinquency and the lure of drugs and alcohol. Raised by a clinically depressed mother, tormented by his angry older brother, subjected to the unpredictability of troubled step-fathers and longing for contact with his father, a former heroin addict and ex-con, Jollett slowly, often painfully, builds a life that leads him to Stanford University and, eventually, to finding his voice as a writer and musician. Hollywood Park is told at first through the limited perspective of a child, and then broadens as Jollett begins to understand the world around him. Although Mikel Jollett\u2019s story is filled with heartbreak, it is ultimately an unforgettable portrayal of love at its fiercest and most loyal."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 9, "weeks_on_list": 11, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0735225311", "primary_isbn13": "9780735225312", "publisher": "Viking", "description": "The true story of a Baltimore socialite who joined a spy organization during World War II and became essential to the French Resistance.", "price": "0.00", "title": "A Woman Of No Importance", "author": "Sonia Purnell", "contributor": "by Sonia Purnell", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780735225299.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Woman-No-Importance-Untold-American/dp/073522529X?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/books/review/sonia-purnell-woman-no-importance-virginia-hall.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "073522529X", "isbn13": "9780735225299"}, {"isbn10": "0735225311", "isbn13": "9780735225312"}, {"isbn10": "143286999X", "isbn13": "9781432869991"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Woman-No-Importance-Untold-American/dp/073522529X?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780735225312?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780735225312"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FA%2BWOMAN%2BOF%2BNO%2BIMPORTANCE%2FSonia%2BPurnell%2F9780735225312"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780735225312"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780735225312?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/4f3b65b7-346d-5d48-8001-3e6b2d9f4606", "list_date": "2020/06/14", "published_data": "2020-03-24", "summary": "A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Chosen as a BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR by NPR, the New York Public Library, Amazon, the Seattle Times, the Washington Independent Review of Books, PopSugar, the Minneapolis Star Tribune, BookBrowse, the Spectator, and the Times of London Winner of the Plutarch Award for Best Biography \u201cExcellent\u2026This book is as riveting as any thriller, and as hard to put down.\u201d -- The New York Times Book Review \"A compelling biography of a masterful spy, and a reminder of what can be done with a few brave people -- and a little resistance.\" - NPR \"A meticiulous history that reads like a thriller.\" - Ben Macintyre A never-before-told story of Virginia Hall, the American spy who changed the course of World War II, from the author of Clementine. In 1942, the Gestapo sent out an urgent transmission: \"She is the most dangerous of all Allied spies. We must find and destroy her.\" The target in their sights was Virginia Hall, a Baltimore socialite who talked her way into Special Operations Executive, the spy organization dubbed Winston Churchill's \"Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare.\" She became the first Allied woman deployed behind enemy lines and--despite her prosthetic leg--helped to light the flame of the French Resistance, revolutionizing secret warfare as we know it. Virginia established vast spy networks throughout France, called weapons and explosives down from the skies, and became a linchpin for the Resistance. Even as her face covered wanted posters and a bounty was placed on her head, Virginia refused order after order to evacuate. She finally escaped through a death-defying hike over the Pyrenees into Spain, her cover blown. But she plunged back in, adamant that she had more lives to save, and led a victorious guerilla campaign, liberating swathes of France from the Nazis after D-Day. Based on new and extensive research, Sonia Purnell has for the first time uncovered the full secret life of Virginia Hall--an astounding and inspiring story of heroism, spycraft, resistance, and personal triumph over shocking adversity.

During Andr Leon Talley's first magazine job assisting Andy Warhol at Interview, a fateful meeting with Karl Lagerfeld began a decade's long friendship with the enigmatic, often caustic designer. Propelled into the upper echelons by his knowledge and adoration of fashion, Talley moved to Paris as bureau chief of John Fairchild's Women's Wear Daily, befriending fashion's most important designers. But as Talley made friends, he also made enemies. A racially tinged encounter with a member of the house of Yves Saint Laurent sent him back to New York and into the offices of Vogue under Grace Mirabella. There, he developed an unlikely but intimate friendship with Anna Wintour, and as she rose to the top of Vogue's masthead, Talley became the most influential man in fashion. The Chiffon Trenches is a candid look at the who's who of the last fifty years of fashion, and proof that fact is always fascinatingly more devilish than fiction. Andr Leon Talley's engaging memoir tells the story of how he not only survived but thrived--despite racism, illicit rumors, and all the other challenges of this notoriously cutthroat industry--to become one of the most legendary voices and faces in fashion."}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 6, "weeks_on_list": 7, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "038554376X", "primary_isbn13": "9780385543767", "publisher": "Doubleday", "description": "From 1945 to 1965, a family in Colorado had 12 children, six of whom went on to develop schizophrenia.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Hidden Valley Road", "author": "Robert Kolker", "contributor": "by Robert Kolker", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780385543767.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/038554376X?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "038554376X", "isbn13": "9780385543767"}, {"isbn10": "0385543778", "isbn13": "9780385543774"}, {"isbn10": "0525562648", "isbn13": "9780525562641"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/038554376X?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780385543767?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780385543767"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FHIDDEN%2BVALLEY%2BROAD%2FRobert%2BKolker%2F9780385543767"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780385543767"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780385543767?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/2f5f8f93-d3e5-5210-900b-9fa4fdc3135e", "list_date": "2020/06/07", "published_data": "2020-04-07", "summary": "OPRAH\u2019S BOOK CLUB PICK #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER ONE OF THE NEW YORK TIMES TOP TEN BOOKS OF THE YEAR ONE OF THE WALL STREET JOURNAL TOP TEN BOOKS OF THE YEAR PEOPLE'S #1 BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR ONE OF GQ's TOP 50 BOOKS OF LITERARY JOURNALISM IN THE 21st CENTURY Named a BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR by The New York Times, The Washington Post, NPR, TIME, Slate, Smithsonian, The New York Post, and Amazon The heartrending story of a midcentury American family with twelve children, six of them diagnosed with schizophrenia, that became science's great hope in the quest to understand the disease. Don and Mimi Galvin seemed to be living the American dream. After World War II, Don's work with the Air Force brought them to Colorado, where their twelve children perfectly spanned the baby boom: the oldest born in 1945, the youngest in 1965. In those years, there was an established script for a family like the Galvins--aspiration, hard work, upward mobility, domestic harmony--and they worked hard to play their parts. But behind the scenes was a different story: psychological breakdown, sudden shocking violence, hidden abuse. By the mid-1970s, six of the ten Galvin boys, one after another, were diagnosed as schizophrenic. How could all this happen to one family? What took place inside the house on Hidden Valley Road was so extraordinary that the Galvins became one of the first families to be studied by the National Institute of Mental Health. Their story offers a shadow history of the science of schizophrenia, from the era of institutionalization, lobotomy, and the schizophrenogenic mother to the search for genetic markers for the disease, always amid profound disagreements about the nature of the illness itself. And unbeknownst to the Galvins, samples of their DNA informed decades of genetic research that continues today, offering paths to treatment, prediction, and even eradication of the disease for future generations. With clarity and compassion, bestselling and award-winning author Robert Kolker uncovers one family's unforgettable legacy of suffering, love, and hope."}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 16, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1476740208", "primary_isbn13": "9781476740201", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "description": "The story of the 1986 fire at the Los Angeles Public Library provides a backdrop to the evolution and purpose of libraries.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Library Book", "author": "Susan Orlean", "contributor": "by Susan Orlean", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781476740188.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 482, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Library-Book-Susan-Orlean/dp/1476740186?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/books/review/susan-orlean-library-book.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1476740186", "isbn13": "9781476740188"}, {"isbn10": "1432856464", "isbn13": "9781432856465"}, {"isbn10": "1476740208", "isbn13": "9781476740201"}, {"isbn10": "1508266476", "isbn13": "9781508266471"}, {"isbn10": "1476740194", "isbn13": "9781476740195"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Library-Book-Susan-Orlean/dp/1476740186?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781476740201?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781476740201"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BLIBRARY%2BBOOK%2FSusan%2BOrlean%2F9781476740201"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781476740201"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781476740201?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/9d551d88-70cd-5aa1-b4a0-8cd613d82d09", "list_date": "2020/06/07", "published_data": "2018-10-16", "summary": "A REESE WITHERSPOON x HELLO SUNSHINE BOOK CLUB PICK A WASHINGTON POST TOP 10 BOOK OF THE YEAR * A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER and NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK OF 2018 \u201cA constant pleasure to read\u2026Everybody who loves books should check out The Library Book.\u201d \u2014The Washington Post \u201cCAPTIVATING\u2026DELIGHTFUL.\u201d \u2014Christian Science Monitor * \u201cEXQUISITELY WRITTEN, CONSISTENTLY ENTERTAINING.\u201d \u2014The New York Times * \u201cMESMERIZING\u2026RIVETING.\u201d \u2014Booklist (starred review) A dazzling love letter to a beloved institution\u2014and an investigation into one of its greatest mysteries\u2014from the bestselling author hailed as a \u201cnational treasure\u201d by The Washington Post. On the morning of April 29, 1986, a fire alarm sounded in the Los Angeles Public Library. As the moments passed, the patrons and staff who had been cleared out of the building realized this was not the usual fire alarm. As one fireman recounted, \u201cOnce that first stack got going, it was \u2018Goodbye, Charlie.\u2019\u201d The fire was disastrous: it reached 2000 degrees and burned for more than seven hours. By the time it was extinguished, it had consumed four hundred thousand books and damaged seven hundred thousand more. Investigators descended on the scene, but more than thirty years later, the mystery remains: Did someone purposefully set fire to the library\u2014and if so, who? Weaving her lifelong love of books and reading into an investigation of the fire, award-winning New Yorker reporter and New York Times bestselling author Susan Orlean delivers a mesmerizing and uniquely compelling book that manages to tell the broader story of libraries and librarians in a way that has never been done before. In The Library Book, Orlean chronicles the LAPL fire and its aftermath to showcase the larger, crucial role that libraries play in our lives; delves into the evolution of libraries across the country and around the world, from their humble beginnings as a metropolitan charitable initiative to their current status as a cornerstone of national identity; brings each department of the library to vivid life through on-the-ground reporting; studies arson and attempts to burn a copy of a book herself; reflects on her own experiences in libraries; and reexamines the case of Harry Peak, the blond-haired actor long suspected of setting fire to the LAPL more than thirty years ago. Along the way, Orlean introduces us to an unforgettable cast of characters from libraries past and present\u2014from Mary Foy, who in 1880 at eighteen years old was named the head of the Los Angeles Public Library at a time when men still dominated the role, to Dr. C.J.K. Jones, a pastor, citrus farmer, and polymath known as \u201cThe Human Encyclopedia\u201d who roamed the library dispensing information; from Charles Lummis, a wildly eccentric journalist and adventurer who was determined to make the L.A. library one of the best in the world, to the current staff, who do heroic work every day to ensure that their institution remains a vital part of the city it serves. Brimming with her signature wit, insight, compassion, and talent for deep research, The Library Book is Susan Orlean\u2019s thrilling journey through the stacks that reveals how these beloved institutions provide much more than just books\u2014and why they remain an essential part of the heart, mind, and soul of our country. It is also a master journalist\u2019s reminder that, perhaps especially in the digital era, they are more necessary than ever."}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1546098747", "primary_isbn13": "9781546098744", "publisher": "Center Street", "description": "The \"Fox & Friends Weekend\" host gives his take on politics, culture and education.", "price": "0.00", "title": "American Crusade", "author": "Pete Hegseth", "contributor": "by Pete Hegseth", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781546098744.jpg", "book_image_width": 332, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1546098747?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1546098747", "isbn13": "9781546098744"}, {"isbn10": "1546059261", "isbn13": "9781546059752"}, {"isbn10": "1546099069", "isbn13": "9781546099062"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1546098747?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781546098744?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781546098744"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FAMERICAN%2BCRUSADE%2FPete%2BHegseth%2F9781546098744"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781546098744"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781546098744?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/1afbb8b4-cf07-53f6-82cb-2b1a115ae41a", "list_date": "2020/06/07", "published_data": "2020-04-07", "summary": "Fox & Friends Weekend co-host Pete Hegseth says that America is at a flashpoint-and only a political and cultural Crusade will save our freedoms.

The daughter of a scientist who frequently noted her lack of \u201cgenius,\u201d Angela Duckworth is now a celebrated researcher and professor. It was her early eye-opening stints in teaching, business consulting, and neuroscience that led to her hypothesis about what really drives success: not genius, but a unique combination of passion and long-term perseverance. In Grit, she takes us into the field to visit cadets struggling through their first days at West Point, teachers working in some of the toughest schools, and young finalists in the National Spelling Bee. She also mines fascinating insights from history and shows what can be gleaned from modern experiments in peak performance.

Fame inductees, and stars of the hit E! shows Total Bellas and Total Divas. As twins, the Bellas have always competed. Legend has it that Nikki drop-kicked Brie in the womb so that she could make her grand entrance first. But the rest of the world often treated them as identical and even interchangeable, so they decided to do something about it. After they made it into WWE, the Bellas accomplished so much together: bringing in young girls and women while building the Bella Army, helping the transition of female performers from Divas to Superstars, starring in Total Divas and Total Bellas, and founding companies like Birdiebee, Nicole + Brizee Beauty, and Bonita Bonita Wine. Though their early journey began with loss, abuse, and plenty of rough times, these challenges \u201cshined the diamond.\u201d They resolved to be survivors and the heroes of their own stories, and to take control and responsibility for their lives. Eventually, they would come to show girls everywhere that they can do anything.

I've read every book about the Trump presidency. This is the best.\"\u2014Bill Press An account like no other, from the White House reporter who has known President Donald Trump for more than 25 years. We have never seen a president like this...norm-breaking, rule-busting, dangerously reckless to some and an overdue force for change to others. One thing is clear: We are witnessing the reshaping of the presidency. Jonathan Karl brings us into the White House in a powerful book unlike any other on the Trump administration. He\u2019s known and covered Donald Trump longer than any other White House reporter. With extraordinary access to Trump during the campaign and at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Karl delivers essential new reporting and surprising insights. These are the behind-the-scenes moments that define Trump\u2019s presidency--an extraordinary look at the president, the person, and those closest to him. This is the real story of Trump\u2019s unlikely rise; of the struggles and battles of those who work in the administration and those who report on it; of the plots and schemes of a senior staff enduring stunning and unprecedented unpredictability. Karl takes us from a TV set turned campaign office to the strange quiet of Trump\u2019s White House on Inauguration Day to a high-powered reelection campaign set to change the country\u2019s course. He shows us an administration rewriting the role of the president on the fly and a press corps that has never been more vital. Above all, this book is only possible because of the surprisingly open relationship Donald Trump has had with Jonathan Karl, a reporter he has praised, fought, and branded an enemy of the people. This is Front Row at the Trump Show."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593084292", "primary_isbn13": "9780593084298", "publisher": "Sentinel", "description": "The internet show host explains why he moved away from progressive politics.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Don'T Burn This Book", "author": "Dave Rubin", "contributor": "by Dave Rubin", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593084298.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593084292?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593084292", "isbn13": "9780593084298"}, {"isbn10": "0593084306", "isbn13": "9780593084304"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593084292?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593084298?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593084298"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FDON%2527T%2BBURN%2BTHIS%2BBOOK%2FDave%2BRubin%2F9780593084298"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593084298"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593084298?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/9834d696-e930-5573-b188-c5c7c9e1ec7f", "list_date": "2020/05/17", "published_data": "2020-04-28", "summary": "\"Topical, engaging, personable, and above all, reassuring.\" -Dr. Jordan B. Peterson, author of 12 Rules for Life From host of The Rubin Report, the most-watched talk show about free speech and big ideas on YouTube right now, a roadmap for free thinking in an increasingly censored world. The left is no longer liberal. Once on the side of free speech and tolerance, progressives now ban speakers from college campuses, \"cancel\" people who aren't up to date on the latest genders, and force religious people to violate their conscience. They have abandoned the battle of ideas and have begun fighting a battle of feelings. This uncomfortable truth has turned moderates and true liberals into the politically homeless class. Dave Rubin launched his political talk show The Rubin Report in 2015 as a meeting ground for free thinkers who realize that partisan politics is a dead end. He hosts people he both agrees and disagrees with--including those who have been dismissed, deplatformed, and despised--taking on the most controversial issues of our day. As a result, he's become a voice of reason in a time of madness. Now, Rubin gives you the tools you need to think for yourself in an age when tribal outrage is the only available alternative. Based on his own story as well as his experiences from the front lines of the free speech wars, this book will empower you to make up your own mind about what you believe on any issue and teach you the fine art of: Checking your facts, not your privilege, when it comes to today's most pervasive myths, from the wage gap and gun violence to climate change and hate crimes. Standing up to the mob against today's absurd PC culture, when differences of opinion can bring relationships, professional or personal, to a sudden end. Defending classically liberal principles such as individual rights and limited government, because freedom is impossible without them. The Progressive Woke Machine is waging war against the last free thinkers in the world.

As a member of the strictly religious Satmar sect of Hasidic Judaism, Deborah Feldman grew up under a code of relentlessly enforced customs governing everything from what she could wear and to whom she could speak to what she was allowed to read. Yet in spite of her repressive upbringing, Deborah grew into an independent-minded young woman whose stolen moments reading about the empowered literary characters of Jane Austen and Louisa May Alcott helped her to imagine an alternative way of life among the skyscrapers of Manhattan. Trapped as a teenager in a sexually and emotionally dysfunctional marriage to a man she barely knew, the tension between Deborah\u2019s desires and her responsibilities as a good Satmar girl grew more explosive until she gave birth at nineteen and realized that, regardless of the obstacles, she would have to forge a path\u2014for herself and her son\u2014to happiness and freedom.

Since the day they said, \u201cI do,\u201d Peggy\u2019s previous \u201cdoting\u201d lifestyle met with her husband John\u2019s minimalist ways and became the backdrop for years of adventure and a quirky sense of humor because of their differences. From thoughts of wearing headlamps in the house to save energy, to squeezing out the last drop of toothpaste with a workbench vise, Peggy learned to pick her battles and celebrate the hilarity in each situation. Once their boys were born, woodstove mishaps and garbage dumping tales were the seed for Mike\u2019s obsession with doing dirty jobs and the comical presence he is known for today. As Mike rose to fame, Peggy was his biggest fan\u2014who gave motherly advice and constructive criticism, of course. She baked cookies for Mike to take to Joan Rivers for a Christmas party hostess gift, and even wrote fan letters under faux names and mailed them from different cities to Mike\u2019s producer. By the time Mike hits it big, Peggy and John retire to face more adventures, with a lightning strike in their condo, an elderly friend who ate marijuana leaves, and entering into celebrity status by making Viva paper towel and Lee jeans commercials, plus so much more. Peggy\u2019s stories relive the details that intrigue and entertain old and new fans alike.

An All American gridiron hero, he was also a complex, sometimes confused, soft-hearted romantic wondering how these contradictions fit together. Old-fashioned and out of step with the swipe right dating culture of today, he was saving the most intimate part of life for the love of his life.

One day, Lori Gottlieb is a therapist who helps patients in her Los Angeles practice. The next, a crisis causes her world to come crashing down. Enter Wendell, the quirky but seasoned therapist in whose of\u00adfice she suddenly lands. With his balding head, cardigan, and khakis, he seems to have come straight from Therapist Central Casting. Yet he will turn out to be anything but. As Gottlieb explores the inner chambers of her patients\u2019 lives \u2014 a self-absorbed Hollywood producer, a young newlywed diagnosed with a terminal illness, a senior citizen threatening to end her life on her birthday if nothing gets better, and a twenty-something who can\u2019t stop hooking up with the wrong guys \u2014 she finds that the questions they are struggling with are the very ones she is now bringing to Wendell. With startling wisdom and humor, Gottlieb invites us into her world as both clinician and patient, examining the truths and fictions we tell ourselves and others as we teeter on the tightrope between love and desire, meaning and mortality, guilt and redemption, terror and courage, hope and change.

As seen on Netflix's The Crown. Lady Anne Glenconner has been at the center of the royal circle from childhood, when she met and befriended the future Queen Elizabeth II and her sister, the Princess Margaret. Though the firstborn child of the 5th Earl of Leicester, who controlled one of the largest estates in England, as a daughter she was deemed \"the greatest disappointment\" and unable to inherit. Since then she has needed all her resilience to survive the vipers of court life with her sense of humor intact. A unique witness to landmark moments in royal history, Maid of Honor at Queen Elizabeth's coronation, and a lady in waiting to Princess Margaret until her death in 2002, Lady Anne's life has encompassed extraordinary drama and tragedy. In Lady in Waiting, she will share many intimate royal stories from her time as Princess Margaret's closest confidante as well as her own battle for survival: her broken-off first engagement on the basis of her \"mad blood\"; her 54-year marriage to the volatile, unfaithful Colin Tennant, Lord Glenconner, who left his fortune to a former servant; the death in adulthood of two of her sons; a third son she nursed back from a six-month coma following a horrific motorcycle accident. Through it all, Lady Anne has carried on, traveling the world with the royal family, including visiting the White House, and developing the Caribbean island of Mustique as a safe harbor for the rich and famous-hosting Mick Jagger, David Bowie, Raquel Welch, and many other politicians, aristocrats, and celebrities. With unprecedented insight into the royal family, Lady in Waiting is a witty, candid, dramatic, at times heart-breaking personal story capturing life in a golden cage for a woman with no inheritance."}, {"rank": 6, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1524744972", "primary_isbn13": "9781524744977", "publisher": "Dutton", "description": "An oral history of the sitcom from its beginnings on the BBC through its nine-season run on American network TV.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Office", "author": "Andy Greene", "contributor": "by Andy Greene", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781524744977.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1524744972?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1524744972", "isbn13": "9781524744977"}, {"isbn10": "1524744999", "isbn13": "9781524744991"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1524744972?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781524744977?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781524744977"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BOFFICE%2FAndy%2BGreene%2F9781524744977"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781524744977"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781524744977?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/3dde61e8-8496-5756-9d7d-212c014f9393", "list_date": "2020/04/12", "published_data": "2020-03-24", "summary": "AN INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER The untold stories behind The Office, one of the most iconic television shows of the twenty-first century, told by its creators, writers, and actors When did you last hang out with Jim, Pam, Dwight, Michael, and the rest of Dunder Mifflin? It might have been back in 2013, when the series finale aired . . . or it might have been last night, when you watched three episodes in a row. But either way, long after the show first aired, it\u2019s more popular than ever, and fans have only one problem\u2014what to watch, or read, next. Fortunately, Rolling Stone writer Andy Greene has that answer. In his brand-new oral history, The Office: The Untold Story of the Greatest Sitcom of the 2000s, Greene will take readers behind the scenes of their favorite moments and characters. Greene gives us the true inside story behind the entire show, from its origins on the BBC through its impressive nine-season run in America, with in-depth research and exclusive interviews. Fans will get the inside scoop on key episodes from \"The Dundies\" to \"Threat Level Midnight\" and \"Goodbye, Michael,\" including behind-the-scenes details like the battle to keep it on the air when NBC wanted to pull the plug after just six episodes and the failed attempt to bring in James Gandolfini as the new boss after Steve Carell left, spotlighting the incredible, genre-redefining show created by the family-like team, who together took a quirky British import with dicey prospects and turned it into a primetime giant with true historical and cultural significance.

Here, Katherine Schwarzenegger Pratt shows us what we can learn from those who have struggled with forgiveness, some still struggling, and others who have been able to forgive what might seem truly unforgivable. The book features experiences from those well-known and unknown, including Elizabeth Smart, who learned to forgive her captors; Sue Klebold, whose son, Dylan, was one of the Columbine shooters, learning empathy and how to forgive herself; Chris Williams, who forgave the drunken teenager who killed his wife and child; and of course Schwarzenegger Pratt's own challenges and path to forgiveness in her own life. All provide different journeys to forgiveness and the process--sometimes slow and thorny, sometimes almost instantaneous--by which they learned to forgive and let go. The Gift of Forgiveness is a perfect blend of personal insights, powerful quotations, and hard-won wisdom for those seeking a way to live with greater acceptance, grace, and peace.

In this meticulously reported book\u2014as finely paced as a novel\u2014Keefe uses McConville's murder as a prism to tell the history of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Interviewing people on both sides of the conflict, he transforms the tragic damage and waste of the era into a searing, utterly gripping saga.\" \u2014New York Times Book Review Jean McConville's abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as The Troubles. Everyone in the neighborhood knew the I.R.A. was responsible. But in a climate of fear and paranoia, no one would speak of it. In 2003, five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland, a set of human bones was discovered on a beach. McConville's children knew it was their mother when they were told a blue safety pin was attached to the dress--with so many kids, she had always kept it handy for diapers or ripped clothes. Patrick Radden Keefe's mesmerizing book on the bitter conflict in Northern Ireland and its aftermath uses the McConville case as a starting point for the tale of a society wracked by a violent guerrilla war, a war whose consequences have never been reckoned with. The brutal violence seared not only people like the McConville children, but also I.R.A. members embittered by a peace that fell far short of the goal of a united Ireland, and left them wondering whether the killings they committed were not justified acts of war, but simple murders. From radical and impetuous I.R.A. terrorists such as Dolours Price, who, when she was barely out of her teens, was already planting bombs in London and targeting informers for execution, to the ferocious I.R.A. mastermind known as The Dark, to the spy games and dirty schemes of the British Army, to Gerry Adams, who negotiated the peace but betrayed his hardcore comrades by denying his I.R.A. past--Say Nothing conjures a world of passion, betrayal, vengeance, and anguish.

Unlike natural disasters, whose destruction is concentrated in a limited area over a period of days, and illnesses, which have devastating effects but are limited to individuals and their families, infectious disease has the terrifying power to disrupt everyday life on a global scale, overwhelming public and private resources and bringing trade and transportation to a grinding halt. In today's world, it's easier than ever to move people, animals, and materials around the planet, but the same advances that make modern infrastructure so efficient have made epidemics and even pandemics nearly inevitable. And as outbreaks of COVID-19, Ebola, MERS, and Zika have demonstrated, we are woefully underprepared to deal with the fallout. So what can -- and must -- we do in order to protect ourselves from mankind's deadliest enemy? Drawing on the latest medical science, case studies, policy research, and hard-earned epidemiological lessons, Deadliest Enemy explores the resources and programs we need to develop if we are to keep ourselves safe from infectious disease. The authors show how we could wake up to a reality in which many antibiotics no longer cure, bioterror is a certainty, and the threat of a disastrous influenza or coronavirus pandemic looms ever larger. Only by understanding the challenges we face can we prevent the unthinkable from becoming the inevitable. Deadliest Enemy is high scientific drama, a chronicle of medical mystery and discovery, a reality check, and a practical plan of action."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 11, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1335015922", "primary_isbn13": "9781335015921", "publisher": "Hanover Square", "description": "How the man who became the second president served as the defense lawyer for the British soldiers who stood accused in the Boston Massacre in 1770.", "price": "0.00", "title": "John Adams Under Fire", "author": "Dan Abrams and David Fisher", "contributor": "by Dan Abrams and David Fisher", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781335015921.jpg", "book_image_width": 332, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1335015922?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1335015922", "isbn13": "9781335015921"}, {"isbn10": "1488057222", "isbn13": "9781488057229"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1335015922?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781335015921?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781335015921"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FJOHN%2BADAMS%2BUNDER%2BFIRE%2FDan%2BAbrams%2Band%2BDavid%2BFisher%2F9781335015921"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781335015921"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781335015921?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/9ad839ea-1088-5f1a-8a19-0945642bf999", "list_date": "2020/04/05", "published_data": "2020", "summary": "\"The Boston Massacre has often been called the first shots of the American Revolution.

Admiral Chester Nimitz spoke of the \"uncommon valor\" of the men who fought on Iwo Jima, one of the bloodiest and most brutal battles of World War II. In thirty-six grueling days, nearly 7,000 Marines were killed and 22,000 were wounded. Martha MacCallum takes us from Pearl Harbor to Iwo Jima through the lives of these men of valor, among them Harry Gray, a member of her own family. In Unknown Valor, she weaves their stories--from Boston, Massachusetts, to Gulfport, Mississippi, as told through letters and recollections--into the larger history of what American military leaders rightly saw as an eventual showdown in the Pacific with Japan. In a relentless push through the jungles of Guadalcanal, over the coral reefs of Tarawa, past the bloody ridge of Peleliu, against the banzai charges of Guam, and to the cliffs of Saipan, these men were on a path that ultimately led to the black sands of Iwo Jima, the doorstep of the Japanese Empire. Meticulously researched, heart-wrenching, and illuminating, Unknown Valor reveals the sacrifices of ordinary Marines who saved the world from tyranny and left indelible marks on those back home who loved them."}, {"rank": 5, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0062974688", "primary_isbn13": "9780062974686", "publisher": "Broadside", "description": "The founder of Turning Point U.S.A. espouses some ideas promulgated by President Trump.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Maga Doctrine", "author": "Charlie Kirk", "contributor": "by Charlie Kirk", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780062974686.jpg", "book_image_width": 331, "book_image_height": 500, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062974688?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0062974688", "isbn13": "9780062974686"}, {"isbn10": "006297467X", "isbn13": "9780062974679"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062974688?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780062974686?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780062974686"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BMAGA%2BDOCTRINE%2FCharlie%2BKirk%2F9780062974686"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780062974686"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062974686?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/0b4846cb-7c74-58c6-9bbf-89154d006e7c", "list_date": "2020/03/22", "published_data": "2020", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER. The movement that brought Donald Trump to the White House has better ideas than the old right or the new left. It's time that the rest of America started listening. The Tea Party began as a protest for patriots who feared Big Government. President Trump has become a hero for patriots who are against Big Everything. Fed up with Silicon Valley, the media, liberal higher education, the military-industrial complex, Twitter mobs, swamp monsters, Big Pharma, out-of-control prosecutors, and gun-grabbing fascists, ordinary Americans miss the days when America cared about rule of the people, by the people, and for the people. Remember when you didn't feel bombarded on all sides by coastal billionaires and their government stooges? The MAGA Doctrine urges an overdue restoration of self-rule by a populace long taken for granted by its rulers. Turning Point USA founder and social media superstar Charlie Kirk explains once and for all why a New York real estate magnate found an audience among young conservatives all over the country. Trump and his allies are working to protect all the small things that both parties dismissed: local businesses, families, churches, and the rights of the individual. Kirk explains why it took a reality TV superstar to see past the sclerotic and power-hungry institutions, from the United Nations and Google to Harvard and Viacom, working to crush real America. The Trump Doctrine is all about giving you a say in the future of America and a hand in making it happen. As the mainstream media keep churning out lies about the \"real reasons\" behind the new conservative agenda, Charlie Kirk's The MAGA Doctrine is a powerful reminder of the true narrative of freedom and greatness that swept Donald Trump to the presidency."}, {"rank": 9, "rank_last_week": 4, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0593236661", "primary_isbn13": "9780593236666", "publisher": "Convergent", "description": "The Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer delves into the seven last sayings of Jesus as recorded in the Gospels.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Hope Of Glory", "author": "Jon Meacham", "contributor": "by Jon Meacham", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780593236666.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Hope-Glory-Reflections-Words-Jesus/dp/0593236661?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0593236661", "isbn13": "9780593236666"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Hope-Glory-Reflections-Words-Jesus/dp/0593236661?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780593236666?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780593236666"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BHOPE%2BOF%2BGLORY%2FJon%2BMeacham%2F9780593236666"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780593236666"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593236666?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/9ce43fea-e694-57cb-a88f-c40e3db2c8ea", "list_date": "2020/03/22", "published_data": "2020-02-18", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning author Jon Meacham explores the seven last sayings of Jesus as recorded in the Gospels, combining rich historical and theological insights to reflect on the true heart of the Christian story.

A former vestryman of Trinity Church Wall Street and St. Thomas Church Fifth Avenue, Meacham delves into that intersection of faith and history in this meditation on the seven phrases Jesus spoke from the cross. Beginning with \u201cFather, forgive them, for they do not know what they do\u201d and ending with \u201cFather, into thy hands I commend my spirit,\u201d Meacham captures for the reader how these words epitomize Jesus\u2019s message of love, not hate; grace, not rage; and, rather than vengeance, extraordinary mercy. For each saying, Meacham composes an essay on the origins of Christianity and how Jesus\u2019s final words created a foundation for oral and written traditions that upended the very order of the world. Writing in a tone more intimate than any of his previous works, Jon Meacham returns us to the moment that transformed Jesus from a historical figure into the proclaimed Son of God, worshiped by billions."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 7, "weeks_on_list": 7, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1984877496", "primary_isbn13": "9781984877499", "publisher": "Penguin Press", "description": "The Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists use firsthand accounts to chart patterns of behavior within the Trump administration.", "price": "0.00", "title": "A Very Stable Genius", "author": "Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig", "contributor": "by Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781984877499.jpg", "book_image_width": 326, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Very-Stable-Genius-Testing-America/dp/1984877496?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/books/review-very-stable-genius-donald-trump-philip-rucker-carol-leonnig.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1984877496", "isbn13": "9781984877499"}, {"isbn10": "198487750X", "isbn13": "9781984877505"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Very-Stable-Genius-Testing-America/dp/1984877496?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781984877499?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781984877499"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FA%2BVERY%2BSTABLE%2BGENIUS%2FPhilip%2BRucker%2Band%2BCarol%2BLeonnig%2F9781984877499"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781984877499"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781984877499?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/7b08d86f-867f-5724-8cd3-62d486b5d0d1", "list_date": "2020/03/22", "published_data": "2020-01-21", "summary": "The instant #1 bestseller. \u201cThis taut and terrifying book is among the most closely observed accounts of Donald J.

In fact, there were patterns to his behavior and that of his associates. The universal value of the Trump administration was loyalty\u2014not to the country, but to the president himself\u2014and Trump\u2019s North Star was always the perpetuation of his own power. With deep and unmatched sources throughout Washington, D.C., Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker reveal the forty-fifth president up close. Here, for the first time, certain officials who felt honor-bound not to divulge what they witnessed in positions of trust tell the truth for the benefit of history.

In January 2017, Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. As he delivered his fiery Inaugural address, a grey-haired woman named Rosemary Vrablic sat in the VIP section of the audience. Vrablic was an executive at Deutsche Bank, and without her, Donald Trump probably wouldn\u2019t have been moving into the White House. This is the never-before-told story of how a 150-year-old German bank became the global face of financial recklessness and criminality, a history that traces back to its role helping the Nazis build Auschwitz. In the 1990s, a succession of hard-charging executives made the fateful decision to chase Wall Street riches\u2014and set Deutsche Bank on an epic path of devastation. Its sins included manipulating markets, violating international sanctions, and laundering money for Russian oligarchs. Desperate for an American foothold, Deutsche started doing business with a self-promoting real estate magnate who most banks deemed too dangerous to touch: Donald Trump. Over the next 20 years, Deutsche executives\u2014including a man with a damaged brain, the son of a Supreme Court justice, and Rosemary Vrablic\u2014loaned billions to Trump and the Kushner family. Why? To unravel this mystery, the book traces the rise and fall of Bill Broeksmit, an American executive who was regarded as the conscience of Deutsche Bank. In 2014, he was found hanging in his London apartment. His son gets access to Broeksmit\u2019s computer files and embarks on a wild quest to understand why his father killed himself. The answers he finds will help explain how Deutsche Bank became the financial equivalent of a weapon of mass destruction."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 6, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1524731676", "primary_isbn13": "9781524731670", "publisher": "Knopf", "description": "A physicist gives an overview of how we got here, where we are and directions we might go.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Until The End Of Time", "author": "Brian Greene", "contributor": "by Brian Greene", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781524731670.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 482, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Until-End-Time-Evolving-Universe/dp/1524731676?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/books/review/until-the-end-of-time-brian-greene.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1524731676", "isbn13": "9781524731670"}, {"isbn10": "1524731684", "isbn13": "9781524731687"}, {"isbn10": "0593171721", "isbn13": "9780593171721"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Until-End-Time-Evolving-Universe/dp/1524731676?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781524731670?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781524731670"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FUNTIL%2BTHE%2BEND%2BOF%2BTIME%2FBrian%2BGreene%2F9781524731670"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781524731670"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781524731670?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/b100612d-b584-5f79-b755-5fce00af0db5", "list_date": "2020/03/15", "published_data": "2020", "summary": "From the world-renowned physicist and best-selling author of The Elegant Universe comes this captivating exploration of deep time and humanity's search for purpose.

Through a series of nested stories that explain distinct but interwoven layers of reality--from quantum mechanics to consciousness to black holes--Greene provides us with a clearer sense of how we came to be, a finer picture of where we are now, and a firmer understanding of where we are headed. With this grand tour of the universe, beginning to end, Brian Greene allows us all to grasp and appreciate our fleeting but utterly exquisite moment in the cosmos."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 8, "weeks_on_list": 6, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "006289790X", "primary_isbn13": "9780062897909", "publisher": "Harper", "description": "The author of \u201cClinton Cash\u201d gives his evaluations of members of the Democratic Party.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Profiles In Corruption", "author": "Peter Schweizer", "contributor": "by Peter Schweizer", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780062897909.jpg", "book_image_width": 326, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Profiles-Corruption-Abuse-Americas-Progressive/dp/006289790X?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "006289790X", "isbn13": "9780062897909"}, {"isbn10": "0062897926", "isbn13": "9780062897923"}, {"isbn10": "0062984063", "isbn13": "9780062984067"}, {"isbn10": "1094149683", "isbn13": "9781094149684"}, {"isbn10": "1094149691", "isbn13": "9781094149691"}, {"isbn10": "0062979167", "isbn13": "9780062979162"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Profiles-Corruption-Abuse-Americas-Progressive/dp/006289790X?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780062897909?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780062897909"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FPROFILES%2BIN%2BCORRUPTION%2FPeter%2BSchweizer%2F9780062897909"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780062897909"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062897909?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/a416d851-a161-5d89-9d1f-90a818b3fab3", "list_date": "2020/03/15", "published_data": "2020", "summary": "\"Offers a deep-dive investigation into the private finances and secret deals of some of America's top political leaders\"--"}, {"rank": 5, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1538733552", "primary_isbn13": "9781538733554", "publisher": "Twelve", "description": "A former senior advisor to President Obama offers suggestions for Democrats.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Un-Trumping America", "author": "Dan Pfeiffer", "contributor": "by Dan Pfeiffer", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781538733554.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/-Trumping-America-Plan-Democracy-Again/dp/1538733552?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1538733552", "isbn13": "9781538733554"}, {"isbn10": "1538733560", "isbn13": "9781538733561"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/-Trumping-America-Plan-Democracy-Again/dp/1538733552?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781538733554?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781538733554"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FUN-TRUMPING%2BAMERICA%2FDan%2BPfeiffer%2F9781538733554"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781538733554"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781538733554?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/c8792679-ea09-5701-a014-e92c20d9297c", "list_date": "2020/03/08", "published_data": "2020-02-18", "summary": "From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Yes We (Still) Canand cohost of Pod Save America, a sharp political playbook for how Democrats can take on Trump, McConnell, Fox News, and the rest of the right-wing circus dominating American politics. There is nothing more important than beating Donald Trump in 2020, but defeating Trump is just the start of this timely book. Un-Trumping America offers readers three critical insights: first, Trump is not an aberration, but rather the logical extension of the modern Republican Party; second, how Democrats can defeat Trump in 2020; and third, preventing the likes of Trump from ever happening again with a plan to fix democracy. While the catalog of the president's crimes is long and growing, undoing Trumpism -- the political platform of racism, authoritarianism, and plutocracy that gave rise to Trump and defines the Republican Party -- is a long and continuing fight. Through a craven, cynical strategy engineered by Mitch McConnell, funded by the Kochs, and fueled by Fox News propaganda, Republicans have rigged American politics to drown out the voices of the people in favor of the powerful. Without an aggressive response that recognizes who the Republicans are and what they have done, American democracy as we know it won't survive this moment and a conservative, shrinking, mostly white minority will govern the country for decades. Un-Trumping America dismantles toxic Trumpism and offers a way forward. Dan Pfeiffer worked for nearly twenty years at the center of Democratic politics, from the campaign trail to Capitol Hill to Barack Obama's White House. But it was Trump's victory and Republicans' incessant aiding and abetting of Trumpism that has radicalized his thinking. Here, Pfeiffer urges Democrats to embrace bold solutions -- from fixing the courts to abolishing the electoral college to eliminating the filibuster -- in order to make America more democratic (and Democratic). Un-Trumping America is a powerful call for Democrats and progressives to get smarter, tougher, and more aggressive without becoming a paler shade of orange."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0735224102", "primary_isbn13": "9780735224100", "publisher": "Viking", "description": "A newly researched biography of George Washington.", "price": "0.00", "title": "You Never Forget Your First", "author": "Alexis Coe", "contributor": "by Alexis Coe", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780735224100.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/You-Never-Forget-Your-First/dp/0735224102?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0735224102", "isbn13": "9780735224100"}, {"isbn10": "0735224129", "isbn13": "9780735224124"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/You-Never-Forget-Your-First/dp/0735224102?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780735224100?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780735224100"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FYOU%2BNEVER%2BFORGET%2BYOUR%2BFIRST%2FAlexis%2BCoe%2F9780735224100"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780735224100"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780735224100?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/b90aa5b8-24f0-5ea0-9018-ba5fc2da3ca2", "list_date": "2020/03/08", "published_data": "2020", "summary": "\"In a genre overdue for a shakeup, Alexis Coe takes a closer look at our first--and finds he's not quite the man we remember Young George Washington was raised by a struggling single mother, demanded military promotions, chased rich young women, caused an international incident, and never backed down--even when his dysentery got so bad he had to ride with a cushion on his saddle. But after he married Martha, everything changed. Washington became the kind of man who named his dog Sweetlips and hated to leave home. He took up arms against the British only when there was no other way, though he lost more battles than he won. Coe focuses on his activities off the battlefield--like espionage and propaganda. After an unlikely victory in the Revolutionary War, Washington once again shocked the world by giving up power, only to learn his compatriots wouldn't allow it. The founders pressured him into the presidency--twice. He established enduring norms but left office heartbroken over the partisan nightmare his backstabbing cabinet had created. Back on his plantation, the man who fought for liberty finally confronted his greatest hypocrisy--what to do with the hundreds of men, women, and children he owned--before succumbing to a brutal death. Alexis Coe combines rigorous research and unsentimental storytelling, finally separating the man from the legend.\"--"}, {"rank": 9, "rank_last_week": 5, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "147670032X", "primary_isbn13": "9781476700328", "publisher": "Avid Reader", "description": "The editor at large and co-founder of Vox offers his take on what causes divisions in America.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Why We'Re Polarized", "author": "Ezra Klein", "contributor": "by Ezra Klein", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781476700328.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Why-Were-Polarized-Ezra-Klein/dp/147670032X?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/books/review/why-were-polarized-ezra-klein.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "147670032X", "isbn13": "9781476700328"}, {"isbn10": "1476700397", "isbn13": "9781476700397"}, {"isbn10": "1797107658", "isbn13": "9781797107653"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Why-Were-Polarized-Ezra-Klein/dp/147670032X?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781476700328?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781476700328"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FWHY%2BWE%2527RE%2BPOLARIZED%2FEzra%2BKlein%2F9781476700328"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781476700328"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781476700328?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/7a935a03-7f39-5c36-88e8-1fd814b56bb5", "list_date": "2020/03/01", "published_data": "2020-01-28", "summary": "ONE OF BARACK OBAMA\u2019S FAVORITE BOOKS OF 2022 One of Bill Gates\u2019s \u201c5 books to read this summer,\u201d this New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestseller shows us that America\u2019s political system isn\u2019t broken. The truth is scarier: it\u2019s working exactly as designed. In this \u201csuperbly researched\u201d (The Washington Post) and timely book, journalist Ezra Klein reveals how that system is polarizing us\u2014and how we are polarizing it\u2014with disastrous results. \u201cThe American political system\u2014which includes everyone from voters to journalists to the president\u2014is full of rational actors making rational decisions given the incentives they face,\u201d writes political analyst Ezra Klein. \u201cWe are a collection of functional parts whose efforts combine into a dysfunctional whole.\u201d \u201cA thoughtful, clear and persuasive analysis\u201d (The New York Times Book Review), Why We\u2019re Polarized reveals the structural and psychological forces behind America\u2019s descent into division and dysfunction. Neither a polemic nor a lament, this book offers a clear framework for understanding everything from Trump\u2019s rise to the Democratic Party\u2019s leftward shift to the politicization of everyday culture. America is polarized, first and foremost, by identity. Everyone engaged in American politics is engaged, at some level, in identity politics. Over the past fifty years in America, our partisan identities have merged with our racial, religious, geographic, ideological, and cultural identities. These merged identities have attained a weight that is breaking much in our politics and tearing at the bonds that hold this country together. Klein shows how and why American politics polarized around identity in the 20th century, and what that polarization did to the way we see the world and one another. And he traces the feedback loops between polarized political identities and polarized political institutions that are driving our system toward crisis. \u201cWell worth reading\u201d (New York magazine), this is an \u201ceye-opening\u201d (O, The Oprah Magazine) book that will change how you look at politics\u2014and perhaps at yourself."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1524761400", "primary_isbn13": "9781524761400", "publisher": "Convergent", "description": "The son of conservative Christians cycles from Oregon to Patagonia, reconciling his sexuality with his upbringing.", "price": "0.00", "title": "To Shake The Sleeping Self", "author": "Jedidiah Jenkins", "contributor": "by Jedidiah Jenkins", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781524761387.jpg", "book_image_width": 326, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Shake-Sleeping-Self-Journey-Patagonia/dp/1524761389?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1524761389", "isbn13": "9781524761387"}, {"isbn10": "1524761397", "isbn13": "9781524761394"}, {"isbn10": "1524761400", "isbn13": "9781524761400"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Shake-Sleeping-Self-Journey-Patagonia/dp/1524761389?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781524761400?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781524761400"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTO%2BSHAKE%2BTHE%2BSLEEPING%2BSELF%2FJedidiah%2BJenkins%2F9781524761400"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781524761400"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781524761400?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/a800dd35-bfc3-568a-bcc0-2f775905a6b8", "list_date": "2020/03/01", "published_data": "2019-12-31", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 \u201cWith winning candor, Jedidiah Jenkins takes us with him as he bicycles across two continents and delves deeply into his own beautiful heart.\u201d\u2014Cheryl Strayed, author of Wild and Tiny Beautiful Things On the eve of turning thirty, terrified of being funneled into a life he didn\u2019t choose, Jedidiah Jenkins quit his dream job and spent sixteen months cycling from Oregon to Patagonia.

In 1941, the first Neumann family member was taken by the Nazis, arrested in German-occupied Czechoslovakia for bathing in a stretch of river forbidden to Jews. He was transported to Auschwitz. Eighteen days later his prisoner number was entered into the morgue book. Of thirty-four Neumann family members, twenty-five were murdered by the Nazis. One of the survivors was Hans Neumann, who, to escape the German death net, traveled to Berlin and hid in plain sight under the Gestapo\u2019s eyes. What Hans experienced was so unspeakable that, when he built an industrial empire in Venezuela, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to talk about it. All his daughter Ariana knew was that something terrible had happened. When Hans died, he left Ariana a small box filled with letters, diary entries, and other memorabilia. Ten years later Ariana finally summoned the courage to have the letters translated, and she began reading.

Its twist ending is the most notorious in American film and its closing line of dialogue the most haunting. Here for the first time is the incredible true story of its making. In Sam Wasson's telling, it becomes the defining story of the most colorful characters in the most colorful period of Hollywood history. Here is Jack Nicholson at the height of his powers, as compelling a movie star as there has ever been, embarking on his great, doomed love affair with Anjelica Huston. Here is director Roman Polanski, both predator and prey, haunted by the savage death of his wife, returning to Los Angeles, the scene of the crime, where the seeds of his own self-destruction are quickly planted. Here is the fevered dealmaking of \"The Kid\" Robert Evans, the most consummate of producers. Here too is Robert Towne's fabled script, widely considered the greatest original screenplay ever written. Wasson for the first time peels off layers of myth to provide the true account of its creation. Looming over the story of this classic movie is the imminent eclipse of the '70s filmmaker-friendly studios as they gave way to the corporate Hollywood we know today. In telling that larger story, The Big Goodbye will take its place alongside classics like Easy Riders, Raging Bulls and The Devil's Candy as one of the great movie-world books ever written. Praise for Sam Wasson: \"Wasson is a canny chronicler of old Hollywood and its outsize personalities...More than that, he understands that style matters, and, like his subjects, he has a flair for it.\" - The New Yorker \"Sam Wasson is a fabulous social historian because he finds meaning in situations and stories that would otherwise be forgotten if he didn't sleuth them out, lovingly.\" - Hilton Als"}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 40, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0525431993", "primary_isbn13": "9780525431992", "publisher": "Knopf", "description": "The rise and fall of Theranos, the biotech startup that failed to deliver on its promise to make blood testing more efficient.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Bad Blood", "author": "John Carreyrou", "contributor": "by John Carreyrou", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781524731663.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 493, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Blood-Secrets-Silicon-Startup-ebook/dp/B078VW3VM7?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/21/books/review/bad-blood-john-carreyrou.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "152473165X", "isbn13": "9781524731656"}, {"isbn10": "1524731668", "isbn13": "9781524731663"}, {"isbn10": "1984833634", "isbn13": "9781984833631"}, {"isbn10": "0525431993", "isbn13": "9780525431992"}, {"isbn10": "0593105060", "isbn13": "9780593105061"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Blood-Secrets-Silicon-Startup-ebook/dp/B078VW3VM7?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780525431992?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780525431992"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FBAD%2BBLOOD%2FJohn%2BCarreyrou%2F9780525431992"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780525431992"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780525431992?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/8e0812eb-d9a5-51e1-9e69-d95388750eaf", "list_date": "2020/02/16", "published_data": "2020-01-28", "summary": "NATIONAL BESTSELLER \u2022 The gripping story of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos\u2014one of the biggest corporate frauds in history\u2014a tale of ambition and hubris set amid the bold promises of Silicon Valley, rigorously reported by the prize-winning journalist.

In 2017, a routine network television investigation led Ronan Farrow to a story only whispered about: one of Hollywood's most powerful producers was a predator, protected by fear, wealth, and a conspiracy of silence. As Farrow drew closer to the truth, shadowy operatives, from high-priced lawyers to elite war-hardened spies, mounted a secret campaign of intimidation, threatening his career, following his every move, and weaponizing an account of abuse in his own family. All the while, Farrow and his producer faced a degree of resistance they could not explain -- until now. And a trail of clues revealed corruption and cover-ups from Hollywood to Washington and beyond. This is the untold story of the exotic tactics of surveillance and intimidation deployed by wealthy and connected men to threaten journalists, evade accountability, and silence victims of abuse. And it's the story of the women who risked everything to expose the truth and spark a global movement. Both a spy thriller and a meticulous work of investigative journalism, Catch and Kill breaks devastating new stories about the rampant abuse of power and sheds far-reaching light on investigations that shook our culture.

Christopher Caldwell has spent years studying the liberal uprising of the 1960s and its unforeseen consequences. Even the reforms that Americans love best have come with costs that are staggeringly high\u2014in wealth, freedom, and social stability\u2014and that have been spread unevenly among classes and generations. Caldwell reveals the real political turning points of the past half century, taking readers on a roller-coaster ride through Playboy magazine, affirmative action, CB radio, leveraged buyouts, iPhones, Oxycontin, Black Lives Matter, and internet cookies. In doing so, he shows that attempts to redress the injustices of the past have left Americans living under two different ideas of what it means to play by the rules. Essential, timely, hard to put down, The Age of Entitlement is a brilliant and ambitious argument about how the reforms of the past fifty years gave the country two incompatible political systems\u2014and drove it toward conflict."}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0802147852", "primary_isbn13": "9780802147851", "publisher": "Grove", "description": "The cultural and political contexts of the crises that Generation X women face.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Why We Can'T Sleep", "author": "Ada Calhoun", "contributor": "by Ada Calhoun", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780802147851.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 494, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Cant-Sleep-Midlife/dp/0802147852?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/books/review/ada-calhoun-why-we-cant-sleep-womens-new-midlife-crisis.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0802147852", "isbn13": "9780802147851"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Cant-Sleep-Midlife/dp/0802147852?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780802147851?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780802147851"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FWHY%2BWE%2BCAN%2527T%2BSLEEP%2FAda%2BCalhoun%2F9780802147851"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780802147851"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780802147851?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/789380a7-195f-577c-963c-b0341ce5e18b", "list_date": "2020/02/09", "published_data": "2020-01-07", "summary": "When Ada Calhoun found herself in the throes of a midlife crisis, she thought that she had no right to complain. She was married with children and a good career. So why did she feel miserable? And why did it seem that other Generation X women were miserable, too? Calhoun decided to find some answers. She looked into housing costs, HR trends, credit card debt averages, and divorce data. At every turn, she saw a pattern: sandwiched between the Boomers and the Millennials, Gen X women were facing new problems as they entered middle age, problems that were being largely overlooked. Speaking with women across America about their experiences as the generation raised to \"have it all,\" Calhoun found that most were exhausted, terrified about money, under-employed, and overwhelmed. Instead of their issues being heard, they were told instead to lean in, take \"me-time,\" or make a chore chart to get their lives and homes in order. In Why We Can't Sleep, Calhoun opens up the cultural and political contexts of Gen X's predicament and offers solutions for how to pull oneself out of the abyss--and keep the next generation of women from falling in. The result is reassuring, empowering, and essential reading for all middle-aged women, and anyone who hopes to understand them."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 3, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0525655085", "primary_isbn13": "9780525655084", "publisher": "Knopf", "description": "The Pulitzer Prize-winning authors examine issues affecting working-class Americans.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Tightrope", "author": "Nicholas D Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn", "contributor": "by Nicholas D.

Wilson combines decades of national political experience and insight in his take-no-prisoners analysis, hammering Trump's destructive and dangerous first term in a case-by-case takedown of the worst president in history and describing the terrifying prospect of four more years of Trump. Like no one else can, Wilson blows the lid off Trump's 2020 Republican war machine, showing the exact strategies and tactics they'll use against the Democratic nominee . . . and how the Democrats can avoid the catastrophe waiting for them if they fall into Trump's trap. Running Against the Devil is sharply funny, brutally honest, and infused with his biting commentary. It's a vital indictment of Trump, a no-nonsense, no-holds-barred road map to saving America, and the guide to making Donald Trump a one-term president. The stakes are too high to do anything less\"--"}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 12, "weeks_on_list": 4, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1501144324", "primary_isbn13": "9781501144325", "publisher": "Scribner", "description": "A neuroscientist uses recent scientific discoveries to explain the functions of sleep and dreams.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Why We Sleep", "author": "Matthew Walker", "contributor": "by Matthew Walker", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781501144318.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Sleep-Unlocking-Dreams/dp/1501144316?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1501144316", "isbn13": "9781501144318"}, {"isbn10": "1501144332", "isbn13": "9781501144332"}, {"isbn10": "1501144324", "isbn13": "9781501144325"}, {"isbn10": "1508279314", "isbn13": "9781508279310"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Sleep-Unlocking-Dreams/dp/1501144316?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781501144325?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781501144325"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FWHY%2BWE%2BSLEEP%2FMatthew%2BWalker%2F9781501144325"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781501144325"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781501144325?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/6f7c99ee-b6e0-50d5-9708-5b7a008d4332", "list_date": "2020/02/09", "published_data": "2018-06-19", "summary": "\u201cWhy We Sleep is an important and fascinating book\u2026Walker taught me a lot about this basic activity that every person on Earth needs. I suspect his book will do the same for you.\u201d \u2014Bill Gates A New York Times bestseller and international sensation, this \u201cstimulating and important book\u201d (Financial Times) is a fascinating dive into the purpose and power of slumber. With two appearances on CBS This Morning and Fresh Air's most popular interview of 2017, Matthew Walker has made abundantly clear that sleep is one of the most important but least understood aspects of our life. Until very recently, science had no answer to the question of why we sleep, or what good it served, or why we suffer such devastating health consequences when it is absent. Compared to the other basic drives in life\u2014eating, drinking, and reproducing\u2014the purpose of sleep remains more elusive. Within the brain, sleep enriches a diversity of functions, including our ability to learn, memorize, and make logical decisions. It recalibrates our emotions, restocks our immune system, fine-tunes our metabolism, and regulates our appetite. Dreaming creates a virtual reality space in which the brain melds past and present knowledge, inspiring creativity. In this \u201ccompelling and utterly convincing\u201d (The Sunday Times) book, preeminent neuroscientist and sleep expert Matthew Walker provides a revolutionary exploration of sleep, examining how it affects every aspect of our physical and mental well-being. Charting the most cutting-edge scientific breakthroughs, and marshalling his decades of research and clinical practice, Walker explains how we can harness sleep to improve learning, mood and energy levels, regulate hormones, prevent cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s and diabetes, slow the effects of aging, and increase longevity. He also provides actionable steps towards getting a better night\u2019s sleep every night. Clear-eyed, fascinating, and accessible, Why We Sleep is a crucial and illuminating book. Written with the precision of Atul Gawande, Andrew Solomon, and Sherwin Nuland, it is \u201crecommended for night-table reading in the most pragmatic sense\u201d (The New York Times Book Review)."}, {"rank": 7, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0374278016", "primary_isbn13": "9780374278014", "publisher": "MCD/Farrar, Straus & Giroux", "description": "A millennial\u2019s memoir is interwoven with a look at changes within Silicon Valley.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Uncanny Valley", "author": "Anna Wiener", "contributor": "by Anna Wiener", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780374278014.jpg", "book_image_width": 323, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Uncanny-Valley-Memoir-Anna-Wiener/dp/0374278016?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/31/books/review-uncanny-valley-anna-wiener.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0374278016", "isbn13": "9780374278014"}, {"isbn10": "0374719764", "isbn13": "9780374719760"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Uncanny-Valley-Memoir-Anna-Wiener/dp/0374278016?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780374278014?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780374278014"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FUNCANNY%2BVALLEY%2FAnna%2BWiener%2F9780374278014"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780374278014"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780374278014?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/b7af4d7f-2437-5a2d-b1ea-97468412d03a", "list_date": "2020/02/02", "published_data": "2020-01-14", "summary": "The prescient, page-turning account of a journey in Silicon Valley: a defining memoir of our digital age In her mid-twenties, at the height of tech industry idealism, Anna Wiener\u2014stuck, broke, and looking for meaning in her work, like any good millennial\u2014left a job in book publishing for the promise of the new digital economy. She moved from New York to San Francisco, where she landed at a big-data startup in the heart of the Silicon Valley bubble: a world of surreal extravagance, dubious success, and fresh-faced entrepreneurs hell-bent on domination, glory, and, of course, progress. Anna arrived during a massive cultural shift, as the tech industry rapidly transformed into a locus of wealth and power rivaling Wall Street. But amid the company ski vacations and in-office speakeasies, boyish camaraderie and ride-or-die corporate fealty, a new Silicon Valley began to emerge: one in far over its head, one that enriched itself at the expense of the idyllic future it claimed to be building. Part coming-of-age-story, part portrait of an already bygone era, Anna Wiener\u2019s memoir, Uncanny Valley, is a rare first-person glimpse into high-flying, reckless startup culture at a time of unchecked ambition, unregulated surveillance, wild fortune, and accelerating political power. With wit, candor, and heart, Anna deftly charts the tech industry\u2019s shift from self-appointed world savior to democracy-endangering liability, alongside a personal narrative of aspiration, ambivalence, and disillusionment."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1324001879", "primary_isbn13": "9781324001874", "publisher": "Norton", "description": "An investigative journalist traces the proliferation of the Trump and Kushner dynasties", "price": "0.00", "title": "American Oligarchs", "author": "Andrea Bernstein", "contributor": "by Andrea Bernstein", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781324001874.jpg", "book_image_width": 326, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/American-Oligarchs-Kushners-Trumps-Marriage/dp/1324001879?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/14/books/review/american-oligarchs-andrea-bernstein.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1324001879", "isbn13": "9781324001874"}, {"isbn10": "1324001887", "isbn13": "9781324001881"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/American-Oligarchs-Kushners-Trumps-Marriage/dp/1324001879?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781324001874?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781324001874"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FAMERICAN%2BOLIGARCHS%2FAndrea%2BBernstein%2F9781324001874"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781324001874"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781324001874?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/d4afae4c-c05d-5dac-974c-efa4e54bda98", "list_date": "2020/02/02", "published_data": "2020-01-14", "summary": "A New York Times Bestseller A multigenerational saga of two families, who rose from immigrant roots to the pinnacle of wealth and power, that tracks the unraveling of American democracy. In American Oligarchs, award-winning investigative journalist Andrea Bernstein tells the story of the Trump and Kushner families like never before. Their journey to the White House is a story of survival and loss, crime and betrayal, that stretches from the Klondike Gold Rush, through Nazi-occupied Poland and across the American Century, to our new gilded age. In building and maintaining their dynastic wealth, these families came to embody the rising nationalism and inequality that has pushed the United States to the brink of oligarchy. Building on her landmark reporting for the acclaimed podcast Trump, Inc. and The New Yorker, Bernstein\u2019s painstaking detective work brings to light new information about the families\u2019 arrival as immigrants to America, their paths to success, and the business and personal lives of the president and his closest family members. Bernstein traces how the two families ruthlessly harnessed New York and New Jersey machine politics to gain valuable tax breaks and grew rich on federal programs that bolstered the middle class. She shows how the Trump Organization, denied credit by American banks, turned to shady international capital. She reveals astonishing new details about Charles Kushner\u2019s attempts to ensnare his brother-in-law with a prostitute and explores how Jared Kushner and his father used a venerable New York newspaper to bolster their business empire. Drawing on more than two hundred interviews and more than one hundred thousand pages of documents, many previously unseen or long forgotten, Bernstein shows how the Trumps and the Kushners repeatedly broke rules and then leveraged secrecy, intimidation, and prosecutorial and judicial power to avoid legal consequences. The result is a compelling narrative that details how the Trump and Kushner dynasties encouraged and profited from a system of corruption, dark money, and influence trading, and that reveals the historical turning points and decisions\u2014on taxation, regulation, white-collar crime, and campaign finance laws\u2014that have brought us to where we are today."}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 6, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0735214484", "primary_isbn13": "9780735214484", "publisher": "Riverhead", "description": "An argument for how generalists excel more than specialists, especially in complex and unpredictable fields.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Range", "author": "David Epstein", "contributor": "by David Epstein", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780735214484.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World/dp/0735214484?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/books/review/david-epstein-range.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0735214484", "isbn13": "9780735214484"}, {"isbn10": "0735214492", "isbn13": "9780735214491"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World/dp/0735214484?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780735214484?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780735214484"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FRANGE%2FDavid%2BEpstein%2F9780735214484"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780735214484"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780735214484?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/fc6600b4-9ac9-5013-b552-19df30b03164", "list_date": "2020/01/26", "published_data": "2019-05-28", "summary": "The #1 New York Times bestseller that has all America talking: as seen/heard on CNN's Fareed Zakaria GPS, Morning Joe, CBS This Morning, The Bill Simmons Podcast, Rich Roll, and more. \u201cThe most important business\u2014and parenting\u2014book of the year.\u201d \u2014Forbes \u201cUrgent and important. . . an essential read for bosses, parents, coaches, and anyone who cares about improving performance.\u201d \u2014Daniel H.

Successful Aging uses research from developmental neuroscience and the psychology of individual differences to show that sixty-plus years is a unique developmental stage that, like infancy or adolescence, has its own demands and distinct advantages. Levitin looks at the science behind what we all can learn from those who age joyously, as well as how to adapt our culture to take full advantage of older people's wisdom and experience. Throughout his exploration of what aging really means, Levitin reveals resilience strategies and practical, cognitive enhancing tricks everyone should do as they age. The book is packed with accessible and discussable takeaways, providing great material for reading groups and media coverage. Successful Aging inspires a powerful new approach to how readers think about our final decades, and it will revolutionize the way we plan for old age as individuals, family members, and citizens within a society where the average life expectancy continues to rise."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0062666975", "primary_isbn13": "9780062666970", "publisher": "Harper", "description": "How young men comprehend cultural forces and navigate sexual and emotional relationships.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Boys & Sex", "author": "Peggy Orenstein", "contributor": "by Peggy Orenstein", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780062666970.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Boys-Sex-Hookups-Navigating-Masculinity/dp/0062666975?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0062666975", "isbn13": "9780062666970"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Boys-Sex-Hookups-Navigating-Masculinity/dp/0062666975?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780062666970?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780062666970"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FBOYS%2B%2526%2BSEX%2FPeggy%2BOrenstein%2F9780062666970"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780062666970"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062666970?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/f987476b-4fd3-5af8-9b60-1a7405acedc2", "list_date": "2020/01/26", "published_data": "2020", "summary": "\"To understand girls and sex, we also need to talk about boys and sex.

Drawing on comprehensive interviews with young men, psychologists, academics, and experts in the field, [the author] takes an unprecedented look at the myriad factors that are shaping boys' ideas of sex, girls, and masculinity\"--Provided by publisher."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 11, "weeks_on_list": 13, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1250147603", "primary_isbn13": "9781250147608", "publisher": "Holt", "description": "The multi-award-winning solo artist's first autobiography chronicles his career, relationships and private struggles.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Me", "author": "Elton John", "contributor": "by Elton John", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781250147608.jpg", "book_image_width": 322, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Me-Elton-John-Official-Autobiography/dp/1250147603?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/books/review-me-elton-john-memoir.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1250147603", "isbn13": "9781250147608"}, {"isbn10": "1250147611", "isbn13": "9781250147615"}, {"isbn10": "1250231051", "isbn13": "9781250231055"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Me-Elton-John-Official-Autobiography/dp/1250147603?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781250147608?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781250147608"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FME%2FElton%2BJohn%2F9781250147608"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781250147608"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250147608?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/ebe49014-235b-5234-9e22-379abac7bf4d", "list_date": "2020/01/26", "published_data": "2019-10-15", "summary": "INSTANT #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER In his first and only official autobiography, music icon Elton John reveals the truth about his extraordinary life, from his rollercoaster lifestyle as shown in the film Rocketman, to becoming a living legend. Christened Reginald Dwight, he was a shy boy with Buddy Holly glasses who grew up in the London suburb of Pinner and dreamed of becoming a pop star. By the age of twenty-three he was performing his first gig in America, facing an astonished audience in his bright yellow dungarees, a star-spangled T-shirt, and boots with wings. Elton John had arrived and the music world would never be the same again. His life has been full of drama, from the early rejection of his work with song-writing partner Bernie Taupin to spinning out of control as a chart-topping superstar; from half-heartedly trying to drown himself in his LA swimming pool to disco-dancing with Princess Diana and Queen Elizabeth; from friendships with John Lennon, Freddie Mercury, and George Michael to setting up his AIDS Foundation to conquering Broadway with Aida, The Lion King, and Billy Elliot the Musical. All the while Elton was hiding a drug addiction that would grip him for over a decade. In Me, Elton also writes powerfully about getting clean and changing his life, about finding love with David Furnish and becoming a father. In a voice that is warm, humble, and open, this is Elton on his music and his relationships, his passions and his mistakes. This is a story that will stay with you by a living legend."}, {"rank": 9, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1501134647", "primary_isbn13": "9781501134647", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "description": "An account of the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, based on hundreds of hours of interviews.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Midnight In Chernobyl", "author": "Adam Higginbotham", "contributor": "by Adam Higginbotham", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781501134647.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Midnight-Chernobyl-Greatest-Nuclear-Disaster-ebook/dp/B07GNV7PNH?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1501134647", "isbn13": "9781501134647"}, {"isbn10": "1501134612", "isbn13": "9781501134616"}, {"isbn10": "1508278539", "isbn13": "9781508278535"}, {"isbn10": "1501134639", "isbn13": "9781501134630"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Midnight-Chernobyl-Greatest-Nuclear-Disaster-ebook/dp/B07GNV7PNH?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781501134647?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781501134647"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FMIDNIGHT%2BIN%2BCHERNOBYL%2FAdam%2BHigginbotham%2F9781501134647"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781501134647"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781501134647?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/f8db23b5-b5dd-526d-8645-5f9b9ae9322b", "list_date": "2020/01/19", "published_data": "2019-02-12", "summary": "A New York Times Best Book of the Year A Time Best Book of the Year A Kirkus Reviews Best Nonfiction Book of the Year 2020 Andrew Carnegie Medals for Excellence Winner One of NPR\u2019s Best Books of 2019 Journalist Adam Higginbotham\u2019s definitive, years-in-the-making account of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster\u2014and a powerful investigation into how propaganda, secrecy, and myth have obscured the true story of one of the twentieth century\u2019s greatest disasters. Early in the morning of April 26, 1986, Reactor Number Four of the Chernobyl Atomic Energy Station exploded, triggering history\u2019s worst nuclear disaster. In the thirty years since then, Chernobyl has become lodged in the collective nightmares of the world: shorthand for the spectral horrors of radiation poisoning, for a dangerous technology slipping its leash, for ecological fragility, and for what can happen when a dishonest and careless state endangers its citizens and the entire world. But the real story of the accident, clouded from the beginning by secrecy, propaganda, and misinformation, has long remained in dispute. Drawing on hundreds of hours of interviews conducted over the course of more than ten years, as well as letters, unpublished memoirs, and documents from recently-declassified archives, Adam Higginbotham has written a harrowing and compelling narrative which brings the disaster to life through the eyes of the men and women who witnessed it firsthand. The result is a masterful nonfiction thriller, and the definitive account of an event that changed history: a story that is more complex, more human, and more terrifying than the Soviet myth. Midnight in Chernobyl is an indelible portrait of one of the great disasters of the twentieth century, of human resilience and ingenuity, and the lessons learned when mankind seeks to bend the natural world to his will\u2014lessons which, in the face of climate change and other threats, remain not just vital but necessary."}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 20, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "None", "primary_isbn13": "9781501168697", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "description": "The Pulitzer Prize-winning historian tells the story of the settling of the Northwest Territory through five main characters.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Pioneers", "author": "David McCullough", "contributor": "by David McCullough", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781501168680.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 491, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Pioneers-Heroic-Settlers-Brought-American/dp/1501168681?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/books/review/david-mccullough-pioneers.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1501168681", "isbn13": "9781501168680"}, {"isbn10": "1982131667", "isbn13": "9781982131661"}, {"isbn10": "150827908X", "isbn13": "9781508279082"}, {"isbn10": "1432865099", "isbn13": "9781432865092"}, {"isbn10": "1501168703", "isbn13": "9781501168703"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Pioneers-Heroic-Settlers-Brought-American/dp/1501168681?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781501168697?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781501168697"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BPIONEERS%2FDavid%2BMcCullough%2F9781501168697"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781501168697"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781501168697?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/149b73f3-24c7-5256-9c40-4ad6cf0b729a", "list_date": "2020/01/19"}, {"rank": 5, "rank_last_week": 5, "weeks_on_list": 8, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0525540539", "primary_isbn13": "9780525540533", "publisher": "Sentinel", "description": "The \"Fox & Friends\u201d host gives an account of the battle against the Mexican Army in 1836.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Sam Houston And The Alamo Avengers", "author": "Brian Kilmeade", "contributor": "by Brian Kilmeade", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780525540533.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Sam-Houston-Alamo-Avengers-American/dp/0525540539?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0525540539", "isbn13": "9780525540533"}, {"isbn10": "0593152271", "isbn13": "9780593152270"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Sam-Houston-Alamo-Avengers-American/dp/0525540539?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780525540533?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780525540533"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FSAM%2BHOUSTON%2BAND%2BTHE%2BALAMO%2BAVENGERS%2FBrian%2BKilmeade%2F9780525540533"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780525540533"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780525540533?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/f5b86e00-711b-5f29-8e08-22a25822be9f", "list_date": "2020/01/12", "published_data": "2019-11-05", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER The pulse-pounding story of the fight for Texas by The New York Times bestselling author of George Washington's Secret Six and Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates. In March 1836, the Mexican army led by General Santa Anna massacred more than two hundred Texians who had been trapped in the Alamo. After thirteen days of fighting, American legends Jim Bowie and Davey Crockett died there, along with other Americans who had moved to Texas looking for a fresh start. It was a crushing blow to Texas\u2019s fight for freedom. But the story doesn\u2019t end there. The defeat galvanized the Texian settlers, and under General Sam Houston\u2019s leadership they rallied. Six weeks after the Alamo, Houston and his band of settlers defeated Santa Anna\u2019s army in a shocking victory, winning the independence for which so many had died. Sam Houston and the Alamo Avengers recaptures this pivotal war that changed America forever, and sheds light on the tightrope all war heroes walk between courage and calculation.

Chika Jeune was born three days before the devastating earthquake that decimated Haiti in 2010. She spent her infancy in a landscape of extreme poverty, and when her mother died giving birth to a baby brother, Chika was brought to The Have Faith Haiti Orphanage that Albom operates in Port Au Prince. With no children of their own, the forty-plus children who live, play, and go to school at the orphanage have become family to Mitch and his wife, Janine. Chika\u2019s arrival makes a quick impression. Brave and self-assured, even as a three-year-old, she delights the other kids and teachers. But at age five, Chika is suddenly diagnosed with something a doctor there says, \u201cNo one in Haiti can help you with.\u201d Mitch and Janine bring Chika to Detroit, hopeful that American medical care can soon return her to her homeland. Instead, Chika becomes a permanent part of their household, and their lives, as they embark on a two-year, around-the-world journey to find a cure. As Chika\u2019s boundless optimism and humor teach Mitch the joys of caring for a child, he learns that a relationship built on love, no matter what blows it takes, can never be lost. Told in hindsight, and through illuminating conversations with Chika herself, this is Albom at his most poignant and vulnerable. Chika is a celebration of a girl, her adoptive guardians, and the incredible bond they formed\u2014a devastatingly beautiful portrait of what it means to be a family, regardless of how it is made."}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 15, "weeks_on_list": 13, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0525575472", "primary_isbn13": "9780525575474", "publisher": "Crown", "description": "The MSNBC host argues that the global oil and gas industry has weakened democracies and bolstered authoritarians.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Blowout", "author": "Rachel Maddow", "contributor": "by Rachel Maddow", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780525575474.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Blowout-Corrupted-Democracy-Destructive-Industry/dp/0525575472?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/books/review/blowout-rachel-maddow.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0525575472", "isbn13": "9780525575474"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Blowout-Corrupted-Democracy-Destructive-Industry/dp/0525575472?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780525575474?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780525575474"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FBLOWOUT%2FRachel%2BMaddow%2F9780525575474"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780525575474"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780525575474?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/794cf276-a10a-5253-b4e5-7882a04515bc", "list_date": "2020/01/12", "published_data": "2019-10-01", "summary": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 Big Oil and Gas Versus Democracy\u2014Winner Take All \u201cA rollickingly well-written book, filled with fascinating, exciting, and alarming stories about the impact of the oil and gas industry on the world today.\u201d\u2014The New York Times Book Review In 2010, the words \u201cearthquake swarm\u201d entered the lexicon in Oklahoma. That same year, a trove of Michael Jackson memorabilia\u2014including his iconic crystal-encrusted white glove\u2014was sold at auction for over $1 million to a guy who was, officially, just the lowly forestry minister of the tiny nation of Equatorial Guinea. And in 2014, revolutionaries in Ukraine raided the palace of their ousted president and found a zoo of peacocks, gilded toilets, and a floating restaurant modeled after a Spanish galleon. Unlikely as it might seem, there is a thread connecting these events, and Rachel Maddow follows it to its crooked source: the unimaginably lucrative and equally corrupting oil and gas industry. With her trademark black humor, Maddow takes us on a switchback journey around the globe, revealing the greed and incompetence of Big Oil and Gas along the way, and drawing a surprising conclusion about why the Russian government hacked the 2016 U.S. election. She deftly shows how Russia\u2019s rich reserves of crude have, paradoxically, stunted its growth, forcing Vladimir Putin to maintain his power by spreading Russia\u2019s rot into its rivals, its neighbors, the West\u2019s most important alliances, and the United States. Chevron, BP, and a host of other industry players get their star turn, most notably ExxonMobil and the deceptively well-behaved Rex Tillerson. The oil and gas industry has weakened democracies in developed and developing countries, fouled oceans and rivers, and propped up authoritarian thieves and killers. But being outraged at it is, according to Maddow, \u201clike being indignant when a lion takes down and eats a gazelle. You can\u2019t really blame the lion. It\u2019s in her nature.\u201d Blowout is a call to contain the lion: to stop subsidizing the wealthiest businesses on earth, to fight for transparency, and to check the influence of the world\u2019s most destructive industry and its enablers. The stakes have never been higher. As Maddow writes, \u201cDemocracy either wins this one or disappears.\u201d"}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 11, "weeks_on_list": 8, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "154608603X", "primary_isbn13": "9781546086031", "publisher": "Center Street", "description": "Forays into politics and views on liberals from the executive vice president of the Trump Organization.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Triggered", "author": "Donald Trump Jr", "contributor": "by Donald Trump Jr", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781546086031.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Triggered-Left-Thrives-Wants-Silence/dp/154608603X?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "154608603X", "isbn13": "9781546086031"}, {"isbn10": "1546086021", "isbn13": "9781546086024"}, {"isbn10": "1549155245", "isbn13": "9781549155246"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Triggered-Left-Thrives-Wants-Silence/dp/154608603X?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781546086031?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781546086031"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTRIGGERED%2FDonald%2BTrump%2BJr%2F9781546086031"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781546086031"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781546086031?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/13733183-8697-564d-94bb-5792f5c8f312", "list_date": "2020/01/12", "published_data": "2019-11-05", "summary": "This is the book that the leftist elites don't want you to read -- Donald Trump, Jr., exposes all the tricks that the left uses to smear conservatives and push them out of the public square, from online \"shadow banning\" to rampant \"political correctness.\" In Triggered, Donald Trump, Jr. will expose all the tricks that the left uses to smear conservatives and push them out of the public square, from online \"shadow banning\" to fake accusations of \"hate speech.\" No topic is spared from political correctness.

She couldn\u2019t have been more than seven or eight years old. \u201cGo ahead, ask your question,\u201d her father urged, nudging her forward. She smiled shyly and said, \u201cYou\u2019re my hero. Who\u2019s yours?\u201d Many people\u2014especially girls\u2014have asked us that same question over the years. It\u2019s one of our favorite topics. HILLARY: Growing up, I knew hardly any women who worked outside the home. So I looked to my mother, my teachers, and the pages of Life magazine for inspiration. After learning that Amelia Earhart kept a scrapbook with newspaper articles about successful women in male-dominated jobs, I started a scrapbook of my own. Long after I stopped clipping articles, I continued to seek out stories of women who seemed to be redefining what was possible. CHELSEA: This book is the continuation of a conversation the two of us have been having since I was little. For me, too, my mom was a hero; so were my grandmothers. My early teachers were also women. But I grew up in a world very different from theirs. My pediatrician was a woman, and so was the first mayor of Little Rock who I remember from my childhood. Most of my close friends\u2019 moms worked outside the home as nurses, doctors, teachers, professors, and in business. And women were going into space and breaking records here on Earth. Ensuring the rights and opportunities of women and girls remains a big piece of the unfinished business of the twenty-first century. While there\u2019s a lot of work to do, we know that throughout history and around the globe women have overcome the toughest resistance imaginable to win victories that have made progress possible for all of us. That is the achievement of each of the women in this book. So how did they do it? The answers are as unique as the women themselves. Civil rights activist Dorothy Height, LGBTQ trailblazer Edie Windsor, and swimmer Diana Nyad kept pushing forward, no matter what. Writers like Rachel Carson and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie named something no one had dared talk about before. Historian Mary Beard used wit to open doors that were once closed, and Wangari Maathai, who sparked a movement to plant trees, understood the power of role modeling. Harriet Tubman and Malala Yousafzai looked fear in the face and persevered. Nearly every single one of these women was fiercely optimistic\u2014they had faith that their actions could make a difference. And they were right. To us, they are all gutsy women\u2014leaders with the courage to stand up to the status quo, ask hard questions, and get the job done. So in the moments when the long haul seems awfully long, we hope you will draw strength from these stories. We do. Because if history shows one thing, it\u2019s that the world needs gutsy women."}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 8, "weeks_on_list": 7, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1586422383", "primary_isbn13": "9781586422387", "publisher": "Steerforth", "description": "A World War II veteran works for a crime boss and comes into contact with the union boss Jimmy Hoffa.

To paint a house is to kill a man. The paint is the blood that splatters on the walls and floors. In the course of nearly five years of recorded interviews, Frank Sheeran confessed to Charles Brandt that he handled more than twenty-five hits for the mob, and for his friend Hoffa. He also provided intriguing information about the Mafia's role in the murder of JFK. Sheeran learned to kill in the US Army, where he saw an astonishing 411 days of active combat duty in Italy during World War II. After returning home he became a hustler and hit man, working for legendary crime boss Russell Bufalino. Eventually Sheeran would rise to a position of such prominence that in a RICO suit the US government would name him as one of only two non-Italians in conspiracy with the Commission of La Cosa Nostra, alongside the likes of Anthony \"Tony Pro\" Provenzano and Anthony \"Fat Tony\" Salerno. When Bufalino ordered Sheeran to kill Hoffa, the Irishman did the deed, knowing that if he had refused he would have been killed himself.

Mo Rocca has always loved obituaries\u2014reading about the remarkable lives of global leaders, Hollywood heavyweights, and innovators who changed the world. But not every notable life has gotten the send-off it deserves. His quest to right that wrong inspired Mobituaries, his #1 hit podcast. Now with Mobituaries, the book, he has gone much further, with all new essays on artists, entertainers, sports stars, political pioneers, founding fathers, and more. Even if you know the names, you\u2019ve never understood why they matter...until now. Take Herbert Hoover: before he was president, he was the \u201cGreat Humanitarian,\u201d the man who saved tens of millions from starvation. But after less than a year in the White House, the stock market crashed, and all the good he had done seemed to be forgotten. Then there\u2019s Marlene Dietrich, well remembered as a screen goddess, less remembered as a great patriot. Alongside American servicemen on the front lines during World War II, she risked her life to help defeat the Nazis of her native Germany. And what about Billy Carter and history\u2019s unruly presidential brothers? Were they ne\u2019er-do-well liabilities\u2026or secret weapons? Plus, Mobits for dead sports teams, dead countries, the dearly departed station wagon, and dragons. Yes, dragons. Rocca is an expert researcher and storyteller. He draws on these skills here.

How To is a guide to the third kind of approach. It's full of highly impractical advice for everything from landing a plane to digging a hole. Bestselling author and cartoonist Randall Munroe explains how to predict the weather by analyzing the pixels of your Facebook photos. He teaches you how to tell if you're a baby boomer or a 90's kid by measuring the radioactivity of your teeth. He offers tips for taking a selfie with a telescope, crossing a river by boiling it, and powering your house by destroying the fabric of space-time. And if you want to get rid of the book once you're done with it, he walks you through your options for proper disposal, including dissolving it in the ocean, converting it to a vapor, using tectonic plates to subduct it into the Earth's mantle, or launching it into the Sun. By exploring the most complicated ways to do simple tasks, Munroe doesn't just make things difficult for himself and his readers. As he did so brilliantly in What If?, Munroe invites us to explore the most absurd reaches of the possible. Full of clever infographics and fun illustrations, How To is a delightfully mind-bending way to better understand the science and technology underlying the things we do every day."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 13, "weeks_on_list": 6, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0316349259", "primary_isbn13": "9780316349253", "publisher": "Hachette", "description": "The musical theater icon's second installment of her memoir describes her arrival in Hollywood, becoming a mother and her relationship with Blake Edwards.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Home Work", "author": "Julie Andrews and Emma Walton Hamilton", "contributor": "by Julie Andrews and Emma Walton Hamilton", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780316349253.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Home-Work-Memoir-Hollywood-Years/dp/0316349259?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0316349259", "isbn13": "9780316349253"}, {"isbn10": "0306845989", "isbn13": "9780306845987"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Home-Work-Memoir-Hollywood-Years/dp/0316349259?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780316349253?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780316349253"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FHOME%2BWORK%2FJulie%2BAndrews%2Band%2BEmma%2BWalton%2BHamilton%2F9780316349253"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780316349253"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780316349253?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/641e69b0-eee1-53d2-b693-85fb67cf5ada", "list_date": "2019/12/29", "published_data": "2019-10-15", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER In this follow-up to her critically acclaimed memoir, Home, Julie Andrews shares reflections on her astonishing career, including such classics as Mary Poppins, The Sound of Music, and Victor/Victoria.

He was a startlingly original visionary with an imagination deep enough to whip up whole worlds, from the sexy, gritty funk paradise of \u201cUptown\u201d to the mythical landscape of Purple Rain to the psychedelia of \u201cPaisley Park.\u201d But his most ambitious creative act was turning Prince Rogers Nelson, born in Minnesota, into Prince, one of the greatest pop stars of any era. The Beautiful Ones is the story of how Prince became Prince\u2014a first-person account of a kid absorbing the world around him and then creating a persona, an artistic vision, and a life, before the hits and fame that would come to define him. The book is told in four parts. The first is the memoir Prince was writing before his tragic death, pages that bring us into his childhood world through his own lyrical prose. The second part takes us through Prince\u2019s early years as a musician, before his first album was released, via an evocative scrapbook of writing and photos. The third section shows us Prince\u2019s evolution through candid images that go up to the cusp of his greatest achievement, which we see in the book\u2019s fourth section: his original handwritten treatment for Purple Rain\u2014the final stage in Prince\u2019s self-creation, where he retells the autobiography of the first three parts as a heroic journey.

Fusion GPS was founded in 2010 by Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch, two former reporters at The Wall Street Journal who decided to abandon the struggling news business and use their reporting skills to conduct open-source investigations for businesses and law firms\u2014and opposition research for political candidates. In the fall of 2015, they were hired to look into the finances of Donald Trump. What began as a march through a mind-boggling trove of lawsuits, bankruptcies, and sketchy overseas projects soon took a darker turn: The deeper Fusion dug, the more it began to notice names that Simpson and Fritsch had come across during their days covering Russian corruption\u2014and the clearer it became that the focus of Fusion\u2019s research going forward would be Trump\u2019s entanglements with Russia. To help them make sense of what they were seeing, Simpson and Fritsch engaged the services of a former British intelligence agent and Russia expert named Christopher Steele. He would produce a series of memos\u2014which collectively became known as the Steele dossier\u2014that raised deeply alarming questions about the nature of Trump\u2019s ties to a hostile foreign power. Those memos made their way to U.S. intelligence agencies, and then to President Barack Obama and President-elect Trump.

Investigative journalist Lee Smith's The Plot Against the President tells the story of how Congressman Devin Nunes uncovered the operation to bring down the commander-in-chief. While popular opinion holds that Russia subverted democratic processes during the 2016 elections, the real damage was done not by Moscow or any other foreign actor. Rather, this was a slow-moving coup engineered by a coterie of the American elite, the \"deep state,\" targeting not only the president, but also the rest of the country. The plot officially began July 31, 2016 with the counterintelligence investigation that the FBI opened to probe Russian infiltration of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. But the bureau never followed any Russians. In fact, it was an operation to sabotage Trump, the candidate, then president-elect, and finally the presidency. The conspirators included political operatives, law enforcement and intelligence officials, and the press. The plot was uncovered by Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and his investigative team. They understood that the target of the operation wasn't just Trump, but rather the institutions that sustain our republic. A country where operatives use the intelligence and security services to protect their privileges by spying on Americans, coordinating with the press, and using extra-constitutional means to undermine an election then undo a presidency is more like the third world than the republic envisioned by the founding fathers. Without Nunes and his team, the plot against the president -- and against the country -- never would have been revealed. Told from the perspective of Nunes and his crack investigators -- men and women who banded together to do the right thing at a crucial moment for our democracy -- the story of the biggest political scandal in a generation reads like a great detective novel, feels like a classic cowboy movie. The congressman from the cattle capital of California really did fight corruption in Washington. Devin Nunes took on the \"deep state.\""}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1524742848", "primary_isbn13": "9781524742843", "publisher": "Dutton", "description": "A friend and collaborator gives her account of various aspects of her relationship with the late pop star Whitney Houston.", "price": "0.00", "title": "A Song For You", "author": "Ron Crawford", "contributor": "by Robyn Crawford", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781524742843.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Song-You-Life-Whitney-Houston/dp/1524742848?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/books/review/a-song-for-you-my-life-with-whitney-houston-robyn-crawford.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1524742848", "isbn13": "9781524742843"}, {"isbn10": "1524742864", "isbn13": "9781524742867"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Song-You-Life-Whitney-Houston/dp/1524742848?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781524742843?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781524742843"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FA%2BSONG%2BFOR%2BYOU%2FRon%2BCrawford%2F9781524742843"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781524742843"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781524742843?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/8f248500-9de6-533b-b370-4c0473eba943", "list_date": "2019/12/01", "published_data": "2019-11-12", "summary": "The New York Times Bestseller!

One person was there by her side through it all\u2014her best friend, Robyn Crawford. Since Whitney\u2019s death in 2012, Robyn has stayed out of the limelight and held the great joys, wild adventures, and hard truths of her life with Whitney close to her heart. Now, for the first time ever, Crawford opens up in her memoir, A Song for You. With warmth, candor, and an impressive recall of detail, Robyn describes the two meeting as teenagers in the 1980s, and how their lives and friendship evolved as Whitney recorded her first album and Robyn pursued her promising Division I basketball career.

When former FBI Director Robert Mueller III was assigned to the Special Counsel investigation looking into the possibility of Russian interference in the 2016 US election, many Americans felt relieved. But when the report was delivered in April 2019, it was clear that the case was far from closed-and pinning Trump down on conspiracy charges was going to be a lot more difficult than it had first seemed. In The Plot to Betray America, Malcolm Nance, New York Times bestselling author and renowned intelligence expert, reveals exactly how Trump and his inner circle conspired, coordinated, communicated, and eventually strategized to commit the greatest act of treachery in the history of the United States: compromisingthe presidential oath of office in exchange for power and personal enrichment. Seduced by the promises of riches dangled in front of them by Vladimir Putin, the Trump administration eagerly decided to reap the rewards of the plan to put a Kremlin-friendly crony in the Oval Office. And instead of interfering, the Republican Party's faithful William Barr, Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen, Steve Bannon, Rudy Giuliani, Mitch McConnell, Roger Stone, George Papadopoulos, and Jeff Sessions among others did everything they could to facilitate Trump's damage to national security to fill his own pockets. Through in-depth research and interviews with intelligence experts and insiders, Nance charts Trump's deep financial ties to Russia through his family's investments, including those of Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Jared Kushner, and the corrupt behavior of his other double-crossing pro-Moscow associates. Only by untangling the spider web of personal and financial relationships linking the White House to the Kremlin can we start to free ourselves from the constricting clutches of our foreign adversaries and work to rebuild our fractured nation. In this geopolitical page-turner, The Plot to Betray America ultimately sketches the tracks and blueprint of the Trump administration's conspiracy against our country-and how we can still fight to defend democracy, protect our national security, and save the Constitution."}, {"rank": 5, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1455530530", "primary_isbn13": "9781455530533", "publisher": "Grand Central", "description": "A memoir by the bassist and a founding member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Acid For The Children", "author": "Flea", "contributor": "by Flea", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781455530533.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Acid-Children-Memoir-Flea/dp/1455530530?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1455530530", "isbn13": "9781455530533"}, {"isbn10": "1455530522", "isbn13": "9781455530526"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Acid-Children-Memoir-Flea/dp/1455530530?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781455530533?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781455530533"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FACID%2BFOR%2BTHE%2BCHILDREN%2FFlea%2F9781455530533"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781455530533"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781455530533?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/4b1adf7c-8d0b-590f-88c9-eefba348bd64", "list_date": "2019/11/24", "published_data": "2019-11-05", "summary": "New York Times BestsellerA #1 LA Times BestsellerA USA Today BestsellerOne of NPR's \"Favorite Books of 2019\" The iconic bassist and co-founder of the Red Hot Chili Peppers tells his fascinating origin story, complete with all the dizzying highs and the gutter lows you'd want from an LA street rat turned world famous rock star. In Acid for the Children, Flea takes readers on a deeply personal and revealing tour of his formative years, spanning from Australia to the New York City suburbs to, finally, Los Angeles. Through hilarious anecdotes, poetical meditations, and occasional flights of fantasy, Flea deftly chronicles the experiences that forged him as an artist, a musician, and a young man. His dreamy, jazz-inflected prose makes the Los Angeles of the 1970s and 80s come to gritty, glorious life, including the potential for fun, danger, mayhem, or inspiration that lurked around every corner. It is here that young Flea, looking to escape a turbulent home, found family in a community of musicians, artists, and junkies who also lived on the fringe. He spent most of his time partying and committing petty crimes. But it was in music where he found a higher meaning, a place to channel his frustration, loneliness, and love. This left him open to the life-changing moment when he and his best friends, soul brothers, and partners-in-mischief came up with the idea to start their own band, which became the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Acid for the Children is the debut of a stunning new literary voice, whose prose is as witty, entertaining, and wildly unpredictable as the author himself.

Since 1988, Renaissance's signature Medallion fund has generated average annual returns of 66 percent. The firm has earned profits of more than $100 billion; Simons is worth twenty-three billion dollars. Drawing on unprecedented access to Simons and dozens of current and former employees, Zuckerman, a veteran Wall Street Journal investigative reporter, tells the gripping story of how a world-class mathematician and former code breaker mastered the market. Simons pioneered a data-driven, algorithmic approach that's sweeping the world. As Renaissance became a market force, its executives began influencing the world beyond finance. Simons became a major figure in scientific research, education, and liberal politics. Senior executive Robert Mercer is more responsible than anyone else for the Trump presidency, placing Steve Bannon in the campaign and funding Trump's victorious 2016 effort. Mercer also impacted the campaign behind Brexit. The Man Who Solved the Market is a portrait of a modern-day Midas who remade markets in his own image, but failed to anticipate how his success would impact his firm and his country. It's also a story of what Simons's revolution means for the rest of us."}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 5, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1452182752", "primary_isbn13": "9781452182759", "publisher": "Chronicle Prism", "description": "The multi-award-winning actor satirizes the Trump administration with a collection of poems and illustrations.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Dumpty", "author": "John Lithgow", "contributor": "by John Lithgow", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781452182759.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 435, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Dumpty-Trump-Political-Satire-Poetry/dp/1452182752?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1452182752", "isbn13": "9781452182759"}, {"isbn10": "1797201409", "isbn13": "9781797201405"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Dumpty-Trump-Political-Satire-Poetry/dp/1452182752?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781452182759?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781452182759"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FDUMPTY%2FJohn%2BLithgow%2F9781452182759"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781452182759"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781452182759?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/94f63815-3b8e-584e-943a-f79896359287", "list_date": "2019/11/17", "published_data": "2019-10-22", "summary": "Dumpty: The Age of Trump in Verse is a satirical poetry collection from award-winning actor and bestselling author John Lithgow.

For decades, Demi Moore has been synonymous with celebrity. From iconic film roles to high-profile relationships, Moore has never been far from the spotlight--or the headlines. Even as Demi was becoming the highest paid actress in Hollywood, however, she was always outrunning her past, just one step ahead of the doubts and insecurities that defined her childhood. Throughout her rise to fame and during some of the most pivotal moments of her life, Demi battled addiction, body image issues, and childhood trauma that would follow her for years--all while juggling a skyrocketing career and at times negative public perception. As her success grew, Demi found herself questioning if she belonged in Hollywood, if she was a good mother, a good actress--and, always, if she was simply good enough. As much as her story is about adversity, it is also about tremendous resilience. In this deeply candid and reflective memoir, Demi pulls back the curtain and opens up about her career and personal life--laying bare her tumultuous relationship with her mother, her marriages, her struggles balancing stardom with raising a family, and her journey toward open heartedness. Inside Out is a story of survival, success, and surrender--a wrenchingly honest portrayal of one woman's at once ordinary and iconic life."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0525654976", "primary_isbn13": "9780525654971", "publisher": "Knopf", "description": "When her writing mentor Daniel Pearl is captured and beheaded, an Oxford student's life changes course and she becomes a member of a clandestine ops unit of the C.I.A.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Life Undercover", "author": "Amaryllis Fox", "contributor": "by Amaryllis Fox", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780525654971.jpg", "book_image_width": 300, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Life-Undercover-Coming-Age-CIA/dp/0525654976?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0525654976", "isbn13": "9780525654971"}, {"isbn10": "0525654984", "isbn13": "9780525654988"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Life-Undercover-Coming-Age-CIA/dp/0525654976?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780525654971?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780525654971"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FLIFE%2BUNDERCOVER%2FAmaryllis%2BFox%2F9780525654971"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780525654971"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780525654971?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/feebabec-4077-5740-ba91-6bc16938179c", "list_date": "2019/11/03", "published_data": "2019", "summary": "Fox's riveting memoir tells the story of her 10 years in the most elite clandestine ops unit of the CIA, hunting the world's most dangerous terrorists in 16 countries while marrying and giving birth to a daughter."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1538701774", "primary_isbn13": "9781538701775", "publisher": "Twelve", "description": "The Wall Street Journal columnist makes her case that critics of President Trump are undermining our country's foundations.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Resistance (At All Costs)", "author": "Kimberley Strassel", "contributor": "by Kimberley Strassel", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781538701775.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Resistance-At-All-Costs-Breaking/dp/1538701774?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1538701774", "isbn13": "9781538701775"}, {"isbn10": "1538701782", "isbn13": "9781538701782"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Resistance-At-All-Costs-Breaking/dp/1538701774?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781538701775?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781538701775"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FRESISTANCE%2B%2528AT%2BALL%2BCOSTS%2529%2FKimberley%2BStrassel%2F9781538701775"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781538701775"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781538701775?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/17bf6644-bc7a-5164-8afa-f7d70d17800a", "list_date": "2019/11/03", "published_data": "2019-10-15", "summary": "INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Wall Street Journal columnist and bestselling author Kim Strassel argues how the all-out \"Resistance\" has become dangerously reckless in its obstruction of President Trump.

Resistance (At All Costs) makes the opposite case -- that it is Trump's critics, in their zeal to oppose the president, who are undermining our foundations. From the FBI's unprecedented counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign, to bureaucratic sabotage, to media partisanship, to the drive-by character assassination of Trump nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the president's foes have thrown aside norms, due process and the rule of law.

The president\u2019s enemies cite the number of indictments and guilty pleas wracked up by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his associates as proof of Donald Trump and his campaign\u2019s criminal wrongdoing. Yet as Fox News\u2019 legal analyst and commentator Gregg Jarrett makes clear, Mueller\u2019s probe has produced no evidence and no indictments in support of his original mandate. Jarrett shows that while the president\u2019s enemies are desperate and determined to find something, their efforts have proved futile. In this book he outlines the various charges since the publication of The Russia Hoax, including the indictments against Trump long-time confidant and advisor Roger Stone. One by one, he knocks the criminal charges and media-driven innuendo down, making clear that the tens of millions of dollars Mueller has spent has been a wasteful misuse of taxpayer money. Jarrett dives deep into the indictment against Stone to explain just how flimsy the accusations of collusion and conspiracy are. \u201cThe plain truth is that the improper existence of Mueller\u2019s investigation created the crimes Stone stands accused of committing,\u201d Jarret contends. He reveals how the FBI has been complicit in the scheme to frame Trump thanks to a cabal of top former officials, headed by former director James Comey, who worked with phony opposition research paid for by the Clinton campaign to smear Trump. He also exposes the Justice Department\u2019s double standard in charging Trump associates while giving a pass to Clinton cronies, including Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills. Factual, highly persuasive, and damning, this must-read expose makes clear that not only was there no collusion, but there was not even a basis for Mueller\u2019s investigation of this charge that has tainted Trump and his administration, and interfered with his presidency."}, {"rank": 6, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1501189972", "primary_isbn13": "9781501189975", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "description": "The former national security adviser and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations gives an insider's perspective on some of the country's most pivotal moments of the 21st century.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Tough Love", "author": "Susan Rice", "contributor": "by Susan Rice", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781501189975.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Tough-Love-Story-Things-Fighting/dp/1501189972?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/books/review/tough-love-susan-rice.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1501189972", "isbn13": "9781501189975"}, {"isbn10": "1501189999", "isbn13": "9781501189999"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Tough-Love-Story-Things-Fighting/dp/1501189972?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781501189975?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781501189975"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTOUGH%2BLOVE%2FSusan%2BRice%2F9781501189975"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781501189975"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781501189975?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/e22839ed-2b9e-52a9-9f1a-05dd84cfbe32", "list_date": "2019/10/27", "published_data": "2019-10-08", "summary": "Recalling pivotal moments from her dynamic career on the front lines of American diplomacy and foreign policy, Susan E. Rice\u2014National Security Advisor to President Barack Obama and US Ambassador to the United Nations\u2014reveals her surprising story with unflinching candor in this New York Times bestseller. Mother, wife, scholar, diplomat, and fierce champion of American interests and values, Susan Rice powerfully connects the personal and the professional. Taught early, with tough love, how to compete and excel as an African American woman in settings where people of color are few, Susan now shares the wisdom she learned along the way. Laying bare the family struggles that shaped her early life in Washington, DC, she also examines the ancestral legacies that influenced her. Rice\u2019s elders\u2014immigrants on one side and descendants of slaves on the other\u2014had high expectations that each generation would rise. And rise they did, but not without paying it forward\u2014in uniform and in the pulpit, as educators, community leaders, and public servants. Susan too rose rapidly. She served throughout the Clinton administration, becoming one of the nation\u2019s youngest assistant secretaries of state and, later, one of President Obama\u2019s most trusted advisors. Rice provides an insider\u2019s account of some of the most complex issues confronting the United States over three decades, ranging from \u201cBlack Hawk Down\u201d in Somalia to the genocide in Rwanda and the East Africa embassy bombings in the late 1990s, and from conflicts in Libya and Syria to the Ebola epidemic, a secret channel to Iran, and the opening to Cuba during the Obama years. With unmatched insight and characteristic bluntness, she reveals previously untold stories behind recent national security challenges, including confrontations with Russia and China, the war against ISIS, the struggle to contain the fallout from Edward Snowden\u2019s NSA leaks, the U.S. response to Russian interference in the 2016 election, and the surreal transition to the Trump administration. Although you might think you know Susan Rice\u2014whose name became synonymous with Benghazi following her Sunday news show appearances after the deadly 2012 terrorist attacks in Libya\u2014now, through these pages, you truly will know her for the first time. Often mischaracterized by both political opponents and champions, Rice emerges as neither a villain nor a victim, but a strong, resilient, compassionate leader. Intimate, sometimes humorous, but always candid, Tough Love makes an urgent appeal to the American public to bridge our dangerous domestic divides in order to preserve our democracy and sustain our global leadership."}, {"rank": 9, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0525559108", "primary_isbn13": "9780525559108", "publisher": "Penguin Press", "description": "The New York Times columnist gives a deconstruction of the various accounts of what happened leading up to the 2016 presidential election.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Deep State", "author": "James B Stewart", "contributor": "by James B.

What instigated the Russia investigation? Did President Trump's meddling incriminate him? There's no mystery to what Trump thinks. He claims that the Deep State, a cabal of career bureaucrats, is concerned only with protecting its own power and undermining the democratic process. Conversely, James Comey has defended the FBI as incorruptible apolitical public servants who work tirelessly to uphold the rule of law. James B. Stewart sifts these conflicting accounts to present a clear-eyed view of what happened inside the FBI in the lead-up to the 2016 election, drawing on scores of interviews with key FBI, Department of Justice, and White House officials and voluminous transcripts, notes, and internal reports.This is the saga of the FBI's simultaneous investigations of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Stewart shows what was set in motion when Trump fired Comey, triggering the appointment of Robert Mueller as an independent special counsel and causing the FBI to open a formal investigation into the president himself. This unprecedented event joined in ongoing combat the presidency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. There is no room for compromise, but plenty for collateral damage. Deep State goes beyond the limits of the legally constrained Mueller report, showing how the president's obsession with the idea of a conspiracy against him is still upending lives and sending shockwaves through both the FBI and the Department of Justice."}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1324003316", "primary_isbn13": "9781324003311", "publisher": "Norton", "description": "In a hand-picked collection of 101 letters, the celebrity astrophysicist answers a vast array of questions from science to faith and Pluto.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Letters From An Astrophysicist", "author": "Neil deGrasse Tyson", "contributor": "by Neil deGrasse Tyson", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781324003311.jpg", "book_image_width": 305, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Letters-Astrophysicist-Neil-deGrasse-Tyson/dp/1324003316?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1324003316", "isbn13": "9781324003311"}, {"isbn10": "1324003324", "isbn13": "9781324003328"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Letters-Astrophysicist-Neil-deGrasse-Tyson/dp/1324003316?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781324003311?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781324003311"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FLETTERS%2BFROM%2BAN%2BASTROPHYSICIST%2FNeil%2BdeGrasse%2BTyson%2F9781324003311"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781324003311"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781324003311?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/d0669178-69ca-5f98-9e50-295aa4434ebc", "list_date": "2019/10/27", "published_data": "2019-10-08", "summary": "New York Times Bestseller A luminous companion to the phenomenal bestseller Astrophysics for People in a Hurry.

Along the way, Mattis recounts his foundational experiences as a leader, extracting the lessons he has learned about the nature of warfighting and peacemaking, the importance of allies, and the strategic dilemmas\u2014and short-sighted thinking\u2014now facing our nation. He makes it clear why America must return to a strategic footing so as not to continue winning battles but fighting inconclusive wars. Mattis divides his book into three parts: Direct Leadership, Executive Leadership, and Strategic Leadership. In the first part, Mattis recalls his early experiences leading Marines into battle, when he knew his troops as well as his own brothers. In the second part, he explores what it means to command thousands of troops and how to adapt your leadership style to ensure your intent is understood by your most junior troops so that they can own their mission. In the third part, Mattis describes the challenges and techniques of leadership at the strategic level, where military leaders reconcile war\u2019s grim realities with political leaders\u2019 human aspirations, where complexity reigns and the consequences of imprudence are severe, even catastrophic. Call Sign Chaos is a memoir of a life of warfighting and lifelong learning, following along as Mattis rises from Marine recruit to four-star general. It is a journey about learning to lead and a story about how he, through constant study and action, developed a unique leadership philosophy, one relevant to us all."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 11, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "073522370X", "primary_isbn13": "9780735223707", "publisher": "Viking", "description": "A sexual assault victim reclaims her identity and challenges our culture and criminal justice system as they relate to this issue.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Know My Name", "author": "Chanel Miller", "contributor": "by Chanel Miller", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780735223707.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Know-My-Name-Chanel-Miller/dp/073522370X?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/books/review/chanel-miller-know-my-name.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "073522370X", "isbn13": "9780735223707"}, {"isbn10": "0735223718", "isbn13": "9780735223714"}, {"isbn10": "0735223726", "isbn13": "9780735223721"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Know-My-Name-Chanel-Miller/dp/073522370X?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780735223707?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780735223707"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FKNOW%2BMY%2BNAME%2FChanel%2BMiller%2F9780735223707"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780735223707"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780735223707?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/31a1176c-af48-515f-bf20-b099e112559f", "list_date": "2019/10/27", "published_data": "2019-09-24", "summary": "Universally acclaimed, rapturously reviewed, winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award for autobiography, and an instant New York Times bestseller, Chanel Miller's breathtaking memoir \"gives readers the privilege of knowing her not just as Emily Doe, but as Chanel Miller the writer, the artist, the survivor, the fighter.\" (The Wrap). \"I opened Know My Name with the intention to bear witness to the story of a survivor. Instead, I found myself falling into the hands of one of the great writers and thinkers of our time.

I could not put this phenomenal book down.\" --Glennon Doyle, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Love Warrior and Untamed \"Know My Name is a gut-punch, and in the end, somehow, also blessedly hopeful.\" --Washington Post She was known to the world as Emily Doe when she stunned millions with a letter. Brock Turner had been sentenced to just six months in county jail after he was found sexually assaulting her on Stanford's campus. Her victim impact statement was posted on BuzzFeed, where it instantly went viral--viewed by eleven million people within four days, it was translated globally and read on the floor of Congress; it inspired changes in California law and the recall of the judge in the case. Thousands wrote to say that she had given them the courage to share their own experiences of assault for the first time. Now she reclaims her identity to tell her story of trauma, transcendence, and the power of words. It was the perfect case, in many ways--there were eyewitnesses, Turner ran away, physical evidence was immediately secured. But her struggles with isolation and shame during the aftermath and the trial reveal the oppression victims face in even the best-case scenarios. Her story illuminates a culture biased to protect perpetrators, indicts a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable, and, ultimately, shines with the courage required to move through suffering and live a full and beautiful life. Know My Name will forever transform the way we think about sexual assault, challenging our beliefs about what is acceptable and speaking truth to the tumultuous reality of healing. It also introduces readers to an extraordinary writer, one whose words have already changed our world. Entwining pain, resilience, and humor, this memoir will stand as a modern classic.

From choreographed carpet figure skating routines to the unavoidable fact that he was Just. So.

Bold, funny, and totally candid, Where Do I Begin? is sure to be loved by anyone who listens to Elvis live every morning\u2014or anyone who wants to know what really goes on behind the scenes of the pop music machine from the \u201cman who has been as big a part of the industry\u2019s success as anyone\u201d (Ryan Seacrest)."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "006074958X", "primary_isbn13": "9780060749583", "publisher": "Dey St.", "description": "A memoir by the lead singer of Blondie and downtown New York City icon.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Face It", "author": "Debbie Harry", "contributor": "by Debbie Harry", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780060749583.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Face-Memoir-Debbie-Harry/dp/006074958X?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "006074958X", "isbn13": "9780060749583"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Face-Memoir-Debbie-Harry/dp/006074958X?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780060749583?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780060749583"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FFACE%2BIT%2FDebbie%2BHarry%2F9780060749583"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780060749583"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780060749583?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/0e66d849-db7d-5fec-8b41-e333a1f2f68c", "list_date": "2019/10/20", "published_data": "2019-10", "summary": "Debbie Harry invites us into her world for the first time, offering the real and honest truth of her life.

I urge you to read it.\u201d \u2014Katie Couric The first comprehensive oral history of September 11, 2001\u2014a panoramic narrative woven from the voices of Americans on the front lines of an unprecedented national trauma. Over the past eighteen years, monumental literature has been published about 9/11, from Lawrence Wright\u2019s The Looming Tower, which traced the rise of al-Qaeda, to The 9/11 Commission Report, the government\u2019s definitive factual retrospective of the attacks. But one perspective has been missing up to this point\u2014a 360-degree account of the day told through the voices of the people who experienced it. Now, in The Only Plane in the Sky, award-winning journalist and bestselling historian Garrett Graff tells the story of the day as it was lived\u2014in the words of those who lived it. Drawing on never-before-published transcripts, recently declassified documents, original interviews, and oral histories from nearly five hundred government officials, first responders, witnesses, survivors, friends, and family members, Graff paints the most vivid and human portrait of the September 11 attacks yet. Beginning in the predawn hours of airports in the Northeast, we meet the ticket agents who unknowingly usher terrorists onto their flights, and the flight attendants inside the hijacked planes. In New York City, first responders confront a scene of unimaginable horror at the Twin Towers. From a secret bunker underneath the White House, officials watch for incoming planes on radar. Aboard the small number of unarmed fighter jets in the air, pilots make a pact to fly into a hijacked airliner if necessary to bring it down. In the skies above Pennsylvania, civilians aboard United Flight 93 make the ultimate sacrifice in their place. Then, as the day moves forward and flights are grounded nationwide, Air Force One circles the country alone, its passengers isolated and afraid. More than simply a collection of eyewitness testimonies, The Only Plane in the Sky is the historic narrative of how ordinary people grappled with extraordinary events in real time: the father and son working in the North Tower, caught on different ends of the impact zone; the firefighter searching for his wife who works at the World Trade Center; the operator of in-flight telephone calls who promises to share a passenger\u2019s last words with his family; the beloved FDNY chaplain who bravely performs last rites for the dying, losing his own life when the Towers collapse; and the generals at the Pentagon who break down and weep when they are barred from rushing into the burning building to try to rescue their colleagues. At once a powerful tribute to the courage of everyday Americans and an essential addition to the literature of 9/11, The Only Plane in the Sky weaves together the unforgettable personal experiences of the men and women who found themselves caught at the center of an unprecedented human drama. The result is a unique, profound, and searing exploration of humanity on a day that changed the course of history, and all of our lives."}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1642933414", "primary_isbn13": "9781642933413", "publisher": "Post Hill", "description": "The Fox News contributor and former Secret Service agent gives his take on the Mueller investigation.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Exonerated", "author": "Dan Bongino", "contributor": "by Dan Bongino", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781642933413.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Exonerated-Failed-Takedown-President-Donald/dp/1642933414?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1642933414", "isbn13": "9781642933413"}, {"isbn10": "1642933422", "isbn13": "9781642933420"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Exonerated-Failed-Takedown-President-Donald/dp/1642933414?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781642933413?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781642933413"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FEXONERATED%2FDan%2BBongino%2F9781642933413"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781642933413"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781642933413?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/587c43e5-c20e-536f-a1f4-4100bb662dd0", "list_date": "2019/10/13", "published_data": "2019-09-24", "summary": "As seen on The Ben Shapiro Show!

Following a run of New Year's concerts at San Francisco's legendary Fillmore, Patti Smith finds herself tramping the coast of Santa Cruz, about to embark on a year of solitary wandering. Unfettered by logic or time, she draws us into her private wonderland with no design, yet heeding signs--including a talking sign that looms above her, prodding and sparring like the Cheshire Cat. In February, a surreal lunar year begins, bringing with it unexpected turns, heightened mischief, and inescapable sorrow. In a stranger's words, \"Anything is possible: after all, it's the Year of the Monkey.\" For Smith--inveterately curious, always exploring, tracking thoughts, writing--the year evolves as one of reckoning with the changes in life's gyre: with loss, aging, and a dramatic shift in the political landscape of America. Smith melds the western landscape with her own dreamscape. Taking us from California to the Arizona desert; to a Kentucky farm as the amanuensis of a friend in crisis; to the hospital room of a valued mentor; and by turns to remembered and imagined places, this haunting memoir blends fact and fiction with poetic mastery. The unexpected happens; grief and disillusionment set in. But as Smith heads toward a new decade in her own life, she offers this balm to the reader: her wisdom, wit, gimlet eye, and above all, a rugged hope for a better world. Riveting, elegant, often humorous, illustrated by Smith's signature Polaroids, Year of the Monkey is a moving and original work, a touchstone for our turbulent times."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1250244021", "primary_isbn13": "9781250244024", "publisher": "St. Martin's", "description": "The written confidences and daily life of a Jewish teenager in Poland as the Nazis spread throughout Europe from 1939 to 1942.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Renia'S Diary", "author": "Renia Spiegel", "contributor": "by Renia Spiegel", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781250244024.jpg", "book_image_width": 326, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Renias-Diary-Holocaust-Renia-Spiegel/dp/1250244021?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1250244021", "isbn13": "9781250244024"}, {"isbn10": "1250256127", "isbn13": "9781250256126"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Renias-Diary-Holocaust-Renia-Spiegel/dp/1250244021?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781250244024?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781250244024"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FRENIA%2527S%2BDIARY%2FRenia%2BSpiegel%2F9781250244024"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781250244024"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250244024?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/3e610daf-6e6c-509a-80e6-5cf94e9b1e77", "list_date": "2019/10/13", "published_data": "2019-09-24", "summary": "The long-hidden diary of a young Polish woman's life during the Holocaust, translated for the first time into English Renia Spiegel was born in 1924 to an upper-middle class Jewish family living in southeastern Poland, near what was at that time the border with Romania. At the start of 1939 Renia began a diary. \u201cI just want a friend. I want somebody to talk to about my everyday worries and joys. Somebody who would feel what I feel, who would believe me, who would never reveal my secrets. A human being can never be such a friend and that\u2019s why I have decided to look for a confidant in the form of a diary.\u201d And so begins an extraordinary document of an adolescent girl\u2019s hopes and dreams. By the fall of 1939, Renia and her younger sister Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Ariana) were staying with their grandparents in Przemysl, a city in the south, just as the German and Soviet armies invaded Poland. Cut off from their mother, who was in Warsaw, Renia and her family were plunged into war. Like Anne Frank, Renia\u2019s diary became a record of her daily life as the Nazis spread throughout Europe. Renia writes of her mundane school life, her daily drama with best friends, falling in love with her boyfriend Zygmund, as well as the agony of missing her mother, separated by bombs and invading armies. Renia had aspirations to be a writer, and the diary is filled with her poignant and thoughtful poetry. When she was forced into the city\u2019s ghetto with the other Jews, Zygmund is able to smuggle her out to hide with his parents, taking Renia out of the ghetto, but not, ultimately to safety.

Rumors of wrongdoing had long circulated. But in 2017, when Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey began their investigation into the prominent Hollywood producer for the New York Times, his name was still synonymous with power. During months of confidential interviews with top actresses, former Weinstein employees, and other sources, many disturbing and long-buried allegations were unearthed, and a web of onerous secret payouts and nondisclosure agreements was revealed. These shadowy settlements had long been used to hide sexual harassment and abuse, but with a breakthrough reporting technique Kantor and Twohey helped to expose it. But Weinstein had evaded scrutiny in the past, and he was not going down without a fight; he employed a team of high-profile lawyers, private investigators, and other allies to thwart the investigation. When Kantor and Twohey were finally able to convince some sources to go on the record, a dramatic final showdown between Weinstein and the New York Times was set in motion. Nothing could have prepared Kantor and Twohey for what followed the publication of their initial Weinstein story on October 5, 2017. Within days, a veritable Pandora\u2019s box of sexual harassment and abuse was opened. Women all over the world came forward with their own traumatic stories. Over the next twelve months, hundreds of men from every walk of life and industry were outed following allegations of wrongdoing. But did too much change\u2014or not enough? Those questions hung in the air months later as Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford came forward to testify that he had assaulted her decades earlier. Kantor and Twohey, who had unique access to Ford and her team, bring to light the odyssey that led her to come forward, the overwhelming forces that came to bear on her, and what happened after she shared her allegation with the world. In the tradition of great investigative journalism, She Said tells a thrilling story about the power of truth, with shocking new information from hidden sources. Kantor and Twohey describe not only the consequences of their reporting for the #MeToo movement, but the inspiring and affecting journeys of the women who spoke up\u2014for the sake of other women, for future generations, and for themselves."}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 6, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0062820699", "primary_isbn13": "9780062820693", "publisher": "Dey St.", "description": "The Pulitzer Prize-winning author's journey from being an immigrant to being an activist outsider to serving in President Obama\u2019s cabinet.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Education Of An Idealist", "author": "Samantha Power", "contributor": "by Samantha Power", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780062820693.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Education-Idealist-Memoir-Samantha-Power/dp/0062820699?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/books/review/the-education-of-an-idealist-samantha-power.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0062820699", "isbn13": "9780062820693"}, {"isbn10": "0062820710", "isbn13": "9780062820716"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Education-Idealist-Memoir-Samantha-Power/dp/0062820699?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780062820693?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780062820693"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BEDUCATION%2BOF%2BAN%2BIDEALIST%2FSamantha%2BPower%2F9780062820693"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780062820693"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062820693?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/de882fb1-94af-5658-ae54-49728fc21546", "list_date": "2019/10/06", "published_data": "2019-09-10", "summary": "An intimate and powerful memoir by Pulitzer Prize\u2013winner and former U.N.

It\u2019s a seemingly undeniable truth that aging is inevitable. But what if everything we\u2019ve been taught to believe about aging is wrong? What if we could choose our lifespan? In this groundbreaking book, Dr. David Sinclair, leading world authority on genetics and longevity, reveals a bold new theory for why we age. As he writes: \u201cAging is a disease, and that disease is treatable.\u201d This eye-opening and provocative work takes us to the frontlines of research that is pushing the boundaries on our perceived scientific limitations, revealing incredible breakthroughs\u2014many from Dr. David Sinclair\u2019s own lab at Harvard\u2014that demonstrate how we can slow down, or even reverse, aging. The key is activating newly discovered vitality genes, the descendants of an ancient genetic survival circuit that is both the cause of aging and the key to reversing it. Recent experiments in genetic reprogramming suggest that in the near future we may not just be able to feel younger, but actually become younger. Through a page-turning narrative, Dr. Sinclair invites you into the process of scientific discovery and reveals the emerging technologies and simple lifestyle changes\u2014such as intermittent fasting, cold exposure, exercising with the right intensity, and eating less meat\u2014that have been shown to help us live younger and healthier for longer. At once a roadmap for taking charge of our own health destiny and a bold new vision for the future of humankind, Lifespan will forever change the way we think about why we age and what we can do about it."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 12, "weeks_on_list": 4, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1546085181", "primary_isbn13": "9781546085188", "publisher": "Center Street", "description": "The Fox News host posits those she labels anti-Trump conspirators have committed possible crimes and a plot to destroy liberty.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Radicals, Resistance And Revenge", "author": "Jeanine Pirro", "contributor": "by Jeanine Pirro", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781546085188.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Radicals-Resistance-Revenge-Remake-America/dp/1546085181?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1546085181", "isbn13": "9781546085188"}, {"isbn10": "1546085254", "isbn13": "9781546085256"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Radicals-Resistance-Revenge-Remake-America/dp/1546085181?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781546085188?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781546085188"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FRADICALS%252C%2BRESISTANCE%2BAND%2BREVENGE%2FJeanine%2BPirro%2F9781546085188"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781546085188"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781546085188?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/dde280aa-6ecf-5102-8831-2eaa637380b9", "list_date": "2019/10/06", "published_data": "2019-08-27", "summary": "Picking up where her #1 New York Times bestseller, Liars, Leakers and Liberals, left off, Judge Jeanine Pirro exposes the latest chapter in the unfolding liberal attack on our most basic values. For two long years, Donald Trump's presidency has been under siege by the Left and their Deep State fellow travelers who concocted an outrageous case of conspiracy with Russia to keep Trump from doing what he was elected to do: secure America's borders, revive its economy, drain the Washington, D.C. Swamp and restore our constitutional republic. Now that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation has vindicated the Trump campaign and administration, the Department of Justice is hot on the trail of Comey, Brennan, Clapper and the rest of the gang of conspirators who tried to overturn the 2016 election. The Left has dropped all pretense of civility, fairness or decency, revealing the real reason they were so desperate to destroy President Trump. He was the one man who stood in the way of their radical plan to remake America. Judge Pirro's last book, #1 NY Times bestseller, Liars, Leakers and Liberals, exposed the plot to destroy first the Trump campaign and then the Trump administration. Picking up where she left off, Radicals, Resistance and Revenge features Judge Jeanine's keen analysis of explosive new information revealed about the anti-Trump conspirators, their corrupt methods and possible crimes, and dissects the Left's subversive plot against the foundation of American liberty. Overturning presidential elections, nationalizing private industries like healthcare and education, destroying America's borders, erasing its national identity and effectively silencing conservative voices in the cybersphere and public square are just a few examples of the lengths to which the far-left progressives and socialists will go to destroy the America we love and remake it into something unrecognizable: borderless, socialist, and free of any moral compass. Only Donald Trump and his army of patriots can stop this radical plan. Judge Jeanine is sounding the alarm and calling out those who despise our most cherished ideals and institutions, to warn patriotic Americans before it's too late."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 11, "weeks_on_list": 11, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1451642296", "primary_isbn13": "9781451642292", "publisher": "Avid Reader", "description": "The inequality of female desire is explored through the sex lives of a homemaker, a high school student and a restaurant owner.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Three Women", "author": "Lisa Taddeo", "contributor": "by Lisa Taddeo", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781451642292.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 493, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Three-Women-Lisa-Taddeo/dp/1451642296?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/books/review-three-women-lisa-taddeo.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1451642296", "isbn13": "9781451642292"}, {"isbn10": "1451642318", "isbn13": "9781451642315"}, {"isbn10": "1508282072", "isbn13": "9781508282075"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Three-Women-Lisa-Taddeo/dp/1451642296?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781451642292?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781451642292"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHREE%2BWOMEN%2FLisa%2BTaddeo%2F9781451642292"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781451642292"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781451642292?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/d04618a0-18a6-5de7-bfc5-93703ba67ac7", "list_date": "2019/10/06", "published_data": "2019-07-09", "summary": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER * #1 SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER * #1 INDIE NEXT PICK A Best Book of the Year: The Washington Post * NPR * The Atlantic * New York Public Library * Vanity Fair * PBS * Time * Economist * Entertainment Weekly * Financial Times * Shelf Awareness * Guardian * Sunday Times * BBC * Esquire * Good Housekeeping * Elle * Real Simple \u201cTHIS IS THE BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR.

Sean Carroll, theoretical physicist and one of this world\u2019s most celebrated writers on science, rewrites the history of 20th century physics. Already hailed as a masterpiece, Something Deeply Hidden shows for the first time that facing up to the essential puzzle of quantum mechanics utterly transforms how we think about space and time. His reconciling of quantum mechanics with Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity changes, well, everything. Most physicists haven\u2019t even recognized the uncomfortable truth: physics has been in crisis since 1927. Quantum mechanics has always had obvious gaps\u2014which have come to be simply ignored. Science popularizers keep telling us how weird it is, how impossible it is to understand. Academics discourage students from working on the \"dead end\" of quantum foundations. Putting his professional reputation on the line with this audacious yet entirely reasonable book, Carroll says that the crisis can now come to an end. We just have to accept that there is more than one of us in the universe. There are many, many Sean Carrolls. Many of every one of us. Copies of you are generated thousands of times per second. The Many Worlds Theory of quantum behavior says that every time there is a quantum event, a world splits off with everything in it the same, except in that other world the quantum event didn't happen. Step-by-step in Carroll's uniquely lucid way, he tackles the major objections to this otherworldly revelation until his case is inescapably established. Rarely does a book so fully reorganize how we think about our place in the universe. We are on the threshold of a new understanding\u2014of where we are in the cosmos, and what we are made of."}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1250256712", "primary_isbn13": "9781250256713", "publisher": "St. Martin's", "description": "The BBC and CNN political and legal analyst argues that Middle Eastern geopolitics were central to Donald Trump\u2019s election and foreign policy.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Proof Of Conspiracy", "author": "Seth Abramson", "contributor": "by Seth Abramson", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781250256713.jpg", "book_image_width": 326, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Proof-Conspiracy-International-Collusion-Threatening/dp/1250256712?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1250256712", "isbn13": "9781250256713"}, {"isbn10": "1250256720", "isbn13": "9781250256720"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Proof-Conspiracy-International-Collusion-Threatening/dp/1250256712?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781250256713?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781250256713"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FPROOF%2BOF%2BCONSPIRACY%2FSeth%2BAbramson%2F9781250256713"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781250256713"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250256713?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/3034720a-8107-54e6-a9bd-c89b82e9149c", "list_date": "2019/09/22", "published_data": "2019-09-03", "summary": "Instant New York Times Bestseller \"A richly documented indictment of power and corruption.\" \u2014Kirkus Reviews Through diligent research, Seth Abramson exposes a story that U.S. media has largely missed: a pre-election geopolitical conspiracy involving Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Israel, and Russia that sought to put Trump in the White House\u2014and succeeded. In late 2015, convicted pedophile, international dealmaker, and cooperating witness in Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation George Nader convened a secret meeting aboard a massive luxury yacht in the Red Sea. Nader pitched Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Emirati Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and other Middle Eastern leaders a plan for a new pro-U.S., pro-Israel alliance of Arab nations that would fundamentally alter the geopolitics of the Middle East while marginalizing Iran, Qatar, and Turkey. To succeed, the plan would need a highly placed American politician willing to drop sanctions on Russia so that Vladimir Putin would in turn agree to end his support for Iran. They agreed the perfect American partner was Donald Trump, who had benefited immensely from his Saudi, Emirati, and Russian dealings for many years, and who, in 2015, became the only U.S. presidential candidate to argue for a unilateral end to Russian sanctions and a far more hostile approach to Iran. So begins New York Times bestselling author Seth Abramson\u2019s explosive new book Proof of Conspiracy: How Trump's International Collusion Threatens American Democracy, a story of international intrigue whose massive cast of characters includes Israeli intelligence operatives, Russian oligarchs, Saudi death squads, American mercenary companies, Trump\u2019s innermost circle, and several members of the Trump family as well as Trump himself\u2014all part of a clandestine multinational narrative that takes us from Washington, D.C. and Moscow to the Middle Eastern capitals of Riyadh, Abu Dhabi, Jerusalem, Cairo, Tehran, and Doha.

In June 2017, Travis Kalanick, the hard-charging CEO of Uber, was ousted in a boardroom coup that capped a brutal year for the transportation giant. Uber had catapulted to the top of the tech world, yet for many came to symbolize everything wrong with Silicon Valley. Award-winning New York Times technology correspondent Mike Isaac\u2019s Super Pumped presents the dramatic rise and fall of Uber, set against an era of rapid upheaval in Silicon Valley. Backed by billions in venture capital dollars and led by a brash and ambitious founder, Uber promised to revolutionize the way we move people and goods through the world. A near instant \u201cunicorn,\u201d Uber seemed poised to take its place next to Amazon, Apple, and Google as a technology giant. What followed would become a corporate cautionary tale about the perils of startup culture and a vivid example of how blind worship of startup founders can go wildly wrong. Isaac recounts Uber\u2019s pitched battles with taxi unions and drivers, the company\u2019s toxic internal culture, and the bare-knuckle tactics it devised to overcome obstacles in its quest for dominance. With billions of dollars at stake, Isaac shows how venture capitalists asserted their power and seized control of the startup as it fought its way toward its fateful IPO. Based on hundreds of interviews with current and former Uber employees, along with previously unpublished documents, Super Pumped is a page-turning story of ambition and deception, obscene wealth, and bad behavior that explores how blistering technological and financial innovation culminated in one of the most catastrophic twelve-month periods in American corporate history."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0062944428", "primary_isbn13": "9780062944429", "publisher": "Broadside", "description": "The Fox News contributor and former U.S. representative from Utah describes how he believes the Democrats are trying to maintain their grip on power.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Power Grab", "author": "Jason Chaffetz", "contributor": "by Jason Chaffetz", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780062944429.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Power-Grab-Liberal-Undermine-Republic/dp/0062944428?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0062944428", "isbn13": "9780062944429"}, {"isbn10": "0062944436", "isbn13": "9780062944436"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Power-Grab-Liberal-Undermine-Republic/dp/0062944428?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780062944429?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780062944429"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FPOWER%2BGRAB%2FJason%2BChaffetz%2F9780062944429"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780062944429"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062944429?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/8708e623-e4d8-57dc-b608-fa330a631d70", "list_date": "2019/09/22", "published_data": "2019-09-03", "summary": "In the years he served on and eventually chaired the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Chaffetz gained crucial insight into the inner workings of D.C.

Now, in this dazzling collection of nine entirely original essays, written with a rare combination of give and sharpness, wit and fearlessness, she delves into the forces that warp our vision, demonstrating an unparalleled stylistic potency and critical dexterity. Trick Mirror is an enlightening, unforgettable trip through the river of self-delusion that surges just beneath the surface of our lives. This is a book about the incentives that shape us, and about how hard it is to see ourselves clearly through a culture that revolves around the self. In each essay, Tolentino writes about a cultural prism: the rise of the nightmare social internet; the advent of scamming as the definitive millennial ethos; the literary heroine's journey from brave to blank to bitter; the punitive dream of optimization, which insists that everything, including our bodies, should become more efficient and beautiful until we die. Gleaming with Tolentino's sense of humor and capacity to elucidate the impossibly complex in an instant, and marked by her desire to treat the reader with profound honesty, Trick Mirror is an instant classic of the worst decade yet. Advance praise for Trick Mirror \"Jia Tolentino is the best young essayist at work in the United States, one I've consistently admired and learned from, and I was exhilarated to get a whole lot of her at once in Trick Mirror. In these nine essays, she rethinks troubling ingredients of modern life, from the internet to mind-altering drugs to wedding culture. All through the book, single sentences flash like lightning to show something familiar in a startling way, but she also builds extended arguments with her usual, unusual blend of lyricism and skepticism. In the end, we have a picture of America that was as missing as it was needed.\"--Rebecca Solnit, author of Men Explain Things to Me"}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 9, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1524796492", "primary_isbn13": "9781524796495", "publisher": "Bantam", "description": "An inside look into military life by the YouTube personality and former Army Ranger.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Thank You For My Service", "author": "Mat Best with Ross Patterson and Nils Parker", "contributor": "by Mat Best with Ross Patterson and Nils Parker", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781524796495.jpg", "book_image_width": 326, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Thank-You-Service-Mat-Best/dp/1524796492?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1524796492", "isbn13": "9781524796495"}, {"isbn10": "1524796506", "isbn13": "9781524796501"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Thank-You-Service-Mat-Best/dp/1524796492?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781524796495?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781524796495"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHANK%2BYOU%2BFOR%2BMY%2BSERVICE%2FMat%2BBest%2Bwith%2BRoss%2BPatterson%2Band%2BNils%2BParker%2F9781524796495"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781524796495"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781524796495?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/51d28a2f-7288-516b-9c5c-9015934250c7", "list_date": "2019/09/15", "published_data": "2019-08-20", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 The unapologetic, laugh-your-ass-off military memoir both vets and civilians have been waiting for, from a five-tour Army Ranger turned YouTube phenomenon and zealous advocate for veterans Members of the military\u2019s special operations branches share a closely guarded secret: They love their jobs. They relish the opportunity to fight. They are thankful for it, even, and hopeful that maybe, possibly, they\u2019ll also get to kill a bunch of bad guys while they\u2019re at it. You don\u2019t necessarily need to thank them for their service\u2014the pleasure is all theirs. In this hilarious and personal memoir, readers ride shotgun alongside former Army Ranger and private military contractor and current social media phenomenon Mat Best, into the action and its aftermath, both abroad and at home. From surviving a skin infection in the swampy armpit of America (aka Columbus, Georgia) to kicking down doors on the outskirts of Ramadi, from blowing up a truck full of enemy combatants to witnessing the effects of a suicide bombing right in front of your face, Thank You for My Service gives readers who love America and love the good guys fresh insight into what it\u2019s really like inside the minds of the men and women on the front lines. It\u2019s also a sobering yet steadying glimpse at life for veterans after the fighting stops, when the enemy becomes self-doubt or despair and you begin to wonder why anyone should be thanking you for anything, least of all your service. How do you keep going when something you love turns you into somebody you hate? For veterans and their friends and families, Thank You for My Service will offer comfort, in the form of a million laughs, and counsel, as a blueprint for what to do after the war ends and the real fight begins. And for civilians, this is the insider account of military life you won\u2019t find anywhere else, told with equal amounts of heart and balls. It\u2019s Deadpool meets Captain America, except one went to business school and one went to therapy, and it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess which is which."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1612198244", "primary_isbn13": "9781612198248", "publisher": "Melville House", "description": "Discussions with the late chef and TV host from 2003 to 2018.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Anthony Bourdain: The Last Interview And Other Conversations", "author": "with an introduction  Helen Rosner", "contributor": "with an introduction by Helen Rosner", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781612198248.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Anthony-Bourdain-Interview-Other-Conversations/dp/1612198244?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1612198244", "isbn13": "9781612198248"}, {"isbn10": "1612198252", "isbn13": "9781612198255"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Anthony-Bourdain-Interview-Other-Conversations/dp/1612198244?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781612198248?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781612198248"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FANTHONY%2BBOURDAIN%253A%2BTHE%2BLAST%2BINTERVIEW%2BAND%2BOTHER%2BCONVERSATIONS%2Fwith%2Ban%2Bintroduction%2B%2BHelen%2BRosner%2F9781612198248"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781612198248"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781612198248?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/8eebc6d3-ed41-5598-99b6-4b312dc0b03f", "list_date": "2019/09/08", "published_data": "2019-08-20", "summary": "The New York Times Bestseller The brilliant intellect and candor of Anthony Bourdain is on full display in this collection of interviews from throughout his remarkable career, with an introduction from The New Yorker's Helen Rosner.

Without fail, Bourdain is always blisteringly honest\u2014such as when he talks about his battles with addiction, or when detailing his thoughts on restaurant critics. He regularly dispenses arresting insight about how what\u2019s on your plate reveals much of history and politics.

The annual revenue of Koch Industries is bigger than that of Goldman Sachs, Facebook, and US Steel combined. Koch is everywhere: from the fertilizers that make our food to the chemicals that make our pipes to the synthetics that make our carpets and diapers to the Wall Street trading in all these commodities. But few people know much about Koch Industries and that\u2019s because the billionaire Koch brothers have wanted it that way. For five decades, CEO Charles Koch has kept Koch Industries quietly operating in deepest secrecy, with a view toward very, very long-term profits. He\u2019s a genius businessman: patient with earnings, able to learn from his mistakes, determined that his employees develop a reverence for free-market ruthlessness, and a master disrupter. These strategies made him and his brother David together richer than Bill Gates. But there\u2019s another side to this story. If you want to understand how we killed the unions in this country, how we widened the income divide, stalled progress on climate change, and how our corporations bought the influence industry, all you have to do is read this book. Seven years in the making, Kochland \u201cis a dazzling feat of investigative reporting and epic narrative writing, a tour de force that takes the reader deep inside the rise of a vastly powerful family corporation that has come to influence American workers, markets, elections, and the very ideas debated in our public square. Leonard\u2019s work is fair and meticulous, even as it reveals the Kochs as industrial Citizens Kane of our time\u201d (Steve Coll, Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning author of Private Empire)."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 8, "weeks_on_list": 13, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1476773092", "primary_isbn13": "9781476773094", "publisher": "Threshold Editions", "description": "The conservative commentator and radio host makes his case that the press is aligned with political ideology.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Unfreedom Of The Press", "author": "Mark R Levin", "contributor": "by Mark R.

Levin comes a groundbreaking and enlightening book that shows how the great tradition of the American free press has degenerated into a standardless profession that has squandered the faith and trust of the American public, not through actions of government officials, but through its own abandonment of reportorial integrity and objective journalism. Unfreedom of the Press is not just another book about the press. Levin shows how those entrusted with news reporting today are destroying freedom of the press from within: \u201cnot government oppression or suppression,\u201d he writes, but self-censorship, group-think, bias by omission, and passing off opinion, propaganda, pseudo-events, and outright lies as news. With the depth of historical background for which his books are renowned, Levin takes the reader on a journey through the early American patriot press, which proudly promoted the principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, followed by the early decades of the Republic during which newspapers around the young country were open and transparent about their fierce allegiance to one political party or the other. It was only at the start of the Progressive Era and the twentieth century that the supposed \u201cobjectivity of the press\u201d first surfaced, leaving us where we are today: with a partisan party-press overwhelmingly aligned with a political ideology but hypocritically engaged in a massive untruth as to its real nature."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0802125085", "primary_isbn13": "9780802125088", "publisher": "Grove", "description": "Identity and inequality are explored in the history of a family and home in New Orleans both before and after Hurricane Katrina.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Yellow House", "author": "Sarah M Broom", "contributor": "by Sarah M.

Justice Anthony Kennedy slipped out of the Supreme Court building on June 27, 2018, and traveled incognito to the White House to inform President Donald Trump that he was retiring, setting in motion a political process that his successor, Brett Kavanaugh, would denounce three months later as a \u201cnational disgrace\u201d and a \u201ccircus.\u201d Justice on Trial, the definitive insider\u2019s account of Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment to the Supreme Court, is based on extraordinary access to more than one hundred key figures\u2014including the president, justices, and senators\u2014in that ferocious political drama. The Trump presidency opened with the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to succeed the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. But the following year, when Trump drew from the same list of candidates for his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, the justice being replaced was the swing vote on abortion, and all hell broke loose. The judicial confirmation process, on the point of breakdown for thirty years, now proved utterly dysfunctional. Unverified accusations of sexual assault became weapons in a ruthless campaign of personal destruction, culminating in the melodramatic hearings in which Kavanaugh\u2019s impassioned defense resuscitated a nomination that seemed beyond saving. The Supreme Court has become the arbiter of our nation\u2019s most vexing and divisive disputes. With the stakes of each vacancy incalculably high, the incentive to destroy a nominee is nearly irresistible. The next time a nomination promises to change the balance of the Court, Hemingway and Severino warn, the confirmation fight will be even uglier than Kavanaugh\u2019s. A good person might accept that nomination in the na\u00efve belief that what happened to Kavanaugh won\u2019t happen to him because he is a good person. But it can happen, it does happen, and it just happened. The question is whether America will let it happen again."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0525521038", "primary_isbn13": "9780525521037", "publisher": "Knopf", "description": "A collection of essays and speeches written over four decades, including a eulogy for James Baldwin and the author's Nobel lecture.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Source Of Self-Regard", "author": "Toni Morrison", "contributor": "by Toni Morrison", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780525521037.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 491, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Source-Self-Regard-Selected-Speeches-Meditations/dp/0525521038?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/books/review/toni-morrison-source-of-self-regard.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0525521038", "isbn13": "9780525521037"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Source-Self-Regard-Selected-Speeches-Meditations/dp/0525521038?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780525521037?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780525521037"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BSOURCE%2BOF%2BSELF-REGARD%2FToni%2BMorrison%2F9780525521037"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780525521037"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780525521037?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/9fa9909c-7d49-5fe9-8a5a-19e39055587c", "list_date": "2019/08/25", "published_data": "2019-02-12", "summary": "NATIONAL BESTSELLER \u2022 Here is the Nobel Prize winner in her own words: a rich gathering of her most important essays and speeches, spanning four decades that \"speaks to today\u2019s social and political moment as directly as this morning\u2019s headlines\u201d (NPR).

If you've ever laughed your way through David Sedaris's cheerfully misanthropic stories, you might think you know what you're getting with Calypso. You'd be wrong. When he buys a beach house on the Carolina coast, Sedaris envisions long, relaxing vacations spent playing board games and lounging in the sun with those he loves most. And life at the Sea Section, as he names the vacation home, is exactly as idyllic as he imagined, except for one tiny, vexing realization: it's impossible to take a vacation from yourself. With Calypso, Sedaris sets his formidable powers of observation toward middle age and mortality. Make no mistake: these stories are very, very funny--it's a book that can make you laugh 'til you snort, the way only family can. Sedaris's powers of observation have never been sharper, and his ability to shock readers into laughter unparalleled. But much of the comedy here is born out of that vertiginous moment when your own body betrays you and you realize that the story of your life is made up of more past than future. This is beach reading for people who detest beaches, required reading for those who loathe small talk and love a good tumor joke. Calypso is simultaneously Sedaris's darkest and warmest book yet--and it just might be his very best."}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 10, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1250313562", "primary_isbn13": "9781250313560", "publisher": "Flatiron", "description": "The philanthropist shares stories of empowering women to improve society.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Moment Of Lift", "author": "Melinda Gates", "contributor": "by Melinda Gates", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781250240521.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Moment-Lift-Empowering-Women-Changes-ebook/dp/B07FCJPWST?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1250313570", "isbn13": "9781250240521"}, {"isbn10": "1250240522", "isbn13": "9781250313577"}, {"isbn10": "1250313562", "isbn13": "9781250313560"}, {"isbn10": "1250317053", "isbn13": "9781250317056"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Moment-Lift-Empowering-Women-Changes-ebook/dp/B07FCJPWST?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781250313560?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781250313560"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BMOMENT%2BOF%2BLIFT%2FMelinda%2BGates%2F9781250313560"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781250313560"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250313560?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/2e79c0c9-f315-5b2d-9ad5-ce9397fba1e6", "list_date": "2019/08/18", "published_data": "2019-04-23", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u201cIn her book, Melinda tells the stories of the inspiring people she\u2019s met through her work all over the world, digs into the data, and powerfully illustrates issues that need our attention\u2014from child marriage to gender inequity in the workplace.\u201d \u2014 President Barack Obama \u201cThe Moment of Lift is an urgent call to courage.

He lays out what was done afterwards to prevent future Charlottesvilles\u2014and what still needs to be done as America in general and Virginia in particular continue to grapple with their history of racism. Beyond Charlottesville will be the definitive account of an infamous chapter in our history, seared indelibly into memory, sure to be cited for years as a crucial reference point in the long struggle to fight racism, extremism and hate."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 5, "weeks_on_list": 15, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1982129735", "primary_isbn13": "9781982129736", "publisher": "Scribner", "description": "Redacted findings from the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and potential obstruction of justice by the president.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Mueller Report", "author": "with related materials  The Washington Post", "contributor": "with related materials by The Washington Post", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781982129736.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Mueller-Report-Washington-Post/dp/1982129735?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1982129735", "isbn13": "9781982129736"}, {"isbn10": "1982129743", "isbn13": "9781982129743"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Mueller-Report-Washington-Post/dp/1982129735?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781982129736?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781982129736"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BMUELLER%2BREPORT%2Fwith%2Brelated%2Bmaterials%2B%2BThe%2BWashington%2BPost%2F9781982129736"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781982129736"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781982129736?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/d4a74353-2149-5275-9ca2-76e1483163d1", "list_date": "2019/08/18", "published_data": "2019-04-30", "summary": "ONE OF TIME\u2019S 100 BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR The Crucial #1 New York Times Bestseller \u201cThe Mueller report is that rare Washington tell-all that surpasses its pre-publication hype\u2026the best book by far on the workings of the Trump presidency.\u201d \u2014Carlos Lozada, The Washington Post The only book with exclusive analysis by the Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning staff of The Washington Post, and the most complete and authoritative available.

Trump. The 2016 election was a watershed for the United States. But, as Tim Alberta explains in American Carnage, to understand Trump\u2019s victory is to view him not as the creator of this era of polarization and bruising partisanship, but rather as its most manifest consequence. American Carnage is the story of a president\u2019s rise based on a country\u2019s evolution and a party\u2019s collapse. As George W. Bush left office with record-low approval ratings and Barack Obama led a Democratic takeover of Washington, Republicans faced a moment of reckoning: They had no vision, no generation of new leaders, and no energy in the party\u2019s base. Yet Obama\u2019s forceful pursuit of his progressive agenda, coupled with the nation\u2019s rapidly changing cultural and demographic landscape, lit a fire under the right, returning Republicans to power and inviting a bloody struggle for the party\u2019s identity in the post-Bush era. The factions that emerged\u2014one led by absolutists like Jim Jordan and Ted Cruz, the other led by pragmatists like John Boehner and Mitch McConnell\u2014engaged in a series of devastating internecine clashes and attempted coups for control. With the GOP\u2019s internal fissures rendering it legislatively impotent, and that impotence fueling a growing resentment toward the political class and its institutions, the stage was set for an outsider to crash the party. When Trump descended a gilded escalator to announce his run in the summer of 2015, the candidate had met the moment. Only by viewing Trump as the culmination of a decade-long civil war inside the Republican Party\u2014and of the parallel sense of cultural, socioeconomic, and technological disruption during that period\u2014can we appreciate how he won the White House and consider the fundamental questions at the center of America\u2019s current turmoil. How did a party obsessed with the national debt vote for trillion-dollar deficits and record-setting spending increases? How did the party of compassionate conservatism become the party of Muslim bans and walls? How did the party of family values elect a thrice-divorced philanderer? And, most important, how long can such a party survive? Loaded with exclusive reporting and based off hundreds of interviews\u2014including with key players such as President Trump, Paul Ryan, Ted Cruz, John Boehner, Mitch McConnell, Jim DeMint, and Reince Priebus, and many others\u2014American Carnage takes us behind the scenes of this tumultuous period as we\u2019ve never seen it before and establishes Tim Alberta as the premier chronicler of this political era."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0735210934", "primary_isbn13": "9780735210936", "publisher": "Riverhead", "description": "The digital world\u2019s influence on the English language.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Because Internet", "author": "Gretchen McCulloch", "contributor": "by Gretchen McCulloch", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780735210936.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Because-Internet-Understanding-Rules-Language/dp/0735210934?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/books/review-because-internet-understanding-new-rules-language-gretchen-mcculloch.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0735210934", "isbn13": "9780735210936"}, {"isbn10": "0735210950", "isbn13": "9780735210950"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Because-Internet-Understanding-Rules-Language/dp/0735210934?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780735210936?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780735210936"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FBECAUSE%2BINTERNET%2FGretchen%2BMcCulloch%2F9780735210936"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780735210936"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780735210936?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/3823c3b3-542e-5700-84e6-30066e508715", "list_date": "2019/08/11", "published_data": "2019-07-23", "summary": "AN INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER!!

It's the perfect book for understanding how the internet is changing the English language, why that's a good thing, and what our online interactions reveal about who we are. Language is humanity's most spectacular open-source project, and the internet is making our language change faster and in more interesting ways than ever before. Internet conversations are structured by the shape of our apps and platforms, from the grammar of status updates to the protocols of comments and @replies. Linguistically inventive online communities spread new slang and jargon with dizzying speed. What's more, social media is a vast laboratory of unedited, unfiltered words where we can watch language evolve in real time. Even the most absurd-looking slang has genuine patterns behind it. Internet linguist Gretchen McCulloch explores the deep forces that shape human language and influence the way we communicate with one another. She explains how your first social internet experience influences whether you prefer \"LOL\" or \"lol,\" why ~sparkly tildes~ succeeded where centuries of proposals for irony punctuation had failed, what emoji have in common with physical gestures, and how the artfully disarrayed language of animal memes like lolcats and doggo made them more likely to spread."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0812998839", "primary_isbn13": "9780812998832", "publisher": "Random House", "description": "An account of the 2013-14 Ebola epidemic and the potential of more severe outbreaks in the future.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Crisis In The Red Zone", "author": "Richard Preston", "contributor": "by Richard Preston", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780812998832.jpg", "book_image_width": 326, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Crisis-Red-Zone-Deadliest-Outbreaks/dp/0812998839?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/books/review/richard-preston-crisis-in-the-red-zone.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0812998839", "isbn13": "9780812998832"}, {"isbn10": "0812998847", "isbn13": "9780812998849"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Crisis-Red-Zone-Deadliest-Outbreaks/dp/0812998839?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780812998832?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780812998832"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FCRISIS%2BIN%2BTHE%2BRED%2BZONE%2FRichard%2BPreston%2F9780812998832"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780812998832"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780812998832?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/d652e93d-ace5-5508-8e29-1a52f650d1fa", "list_date": "2019/08/11", "published_data": "2019", "summary": "The 2013-2014 Ebola epidemic was the deadliest ever--but the outbreaks continue. Now comes a gripping account of the doctors and scientists fighting to protect us, an urgent wake-up call about the future of emerging viruses--from the #1 bestselling author of The Hot Zone, now a National Geographic original miniseries. This time, Ebola started with a two-year-old child who likely had contact with a wild creature and whose entire family quickly fell ill and died. The ensuing global drama activated health professionals in North America, Europe, and Africa in a desperate race against time to contain the viral wildfire. By the end--as the virus mutated into its deadliest form, and spread farther and faster than ever before--30,000 people would be infected, and the dead would be spread across eight countries on three continents. In this taut and suspenseful medical drama, Richard Preston deeply chronicles the outbreak, in which we saw for the first time the specter of Ebola jumping continents, crossing the Atlantic, and infecting people in America. Rich in characters and conflict--physical, emotional, and ethical--Crisis in the Red Zone is an immersion in one of the great public health calamities of our time. Preston writes of doctors and nurses in the field putting their own lives on the line, of government bureaucrats and NGO administrators moving, often fitfully, to try to contain the outbreak, and of pharmaceutical companies racing to develop drugs to combat the virus. He also explores the charged ethical dilemma over who should and did receive the rare doses of an experimental treatment when they became available at the peak of the disaster. Crisis in the Red Zone makes clear that the outbreak of 2013-2014 is a harbinger of further, more severe outbreaks, and of emerging viruses heretofore unimagined--in any country, on any continent. In our ever more interconnected world, with roads and towns cut deep into the jungles of equatorial Africa, viruses both familiar and undiscovered are being unleashed into more densely populated areas than ever before. The more we discover about the virosphere, the more we realize its deadly potential. Crisis in the Red Zone is an exquisitely timely book, a stark warning of viral outbreaks to come."}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 7, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1524742384", "primary_isbn13": "9781524742386", "publisher": "Dutton", "description": "A historian describes John F.

George Takei has captured hearts and minds worldwide with his captivating stage presence and outspoken commitment to equal rights. But long before he braved new frontiers in Star Trek, he woke up as a four-year-old boy to find his own birth country at war with his father's -- and their entire family forced from their home into an uncertain future. In 1942, at the order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, every person of Japanese descent on the west coast was rounded up and shipped to one of ten \"relocation centers,\" hundreds or thousands of miles from home, where they would be held for years under armed guard. They Called Us Enemy is Takei's firsthand account of those years behind barbed wire, the joys and terrors of growing up under legalized racism, his mother's hard choices, his father's faith in democracy, and the way those experiences planted the seeds for his astonishing future. What does it mean to be American? Who gets to decide? When the world is against you, what can one person do?

From \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d to \u201cBorn in the U.S.A.,\u201d Jon Meacham and Tim McGraw take readers on a moving and insightful journey through eras in American history and the songs and performers that inspired us. Meacham chronicles our history, exploring the stories behind the songs, and Tim McGraw reflects on them as an artist and performer. Their perspectives combine to create a unique view of the role music has played in uniting and shaping a nation. Beginning with the battle hymns of the revolution, and taking us through songs from the defining events of the Civil War, the fight for women\u2019s suffrage, the two world wars, the Great Depression, the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War, and into the twenty-first century, Meacham and McGraw explore the songs that defined generations, and the cultural and political climates that produced them. Readers will discover the power of music in the lives of figures such as Harriet Tubman, Franklin Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Martin Luther King, Jr., and will learn more about some of our most beloved musicians and performers, including Marian Anderson, Elvis Presley, Sam Cooke, Aretha Franklin, Bob Dylan, Duke Ellington, Carole King, Bruce Springsteen, and more. Songs of America explores both famous songs and lesser-known ones, expanding our understanding of the scope of American music and lending deeper meaning to the historical context of such songs as \u201cMy Country, \u2019Tis of Thee,\u201d \u201cGod Bless America,\u201d \u201cOver There,\u201d \u201cWe Shall Overcome,\u201d and \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind.\u201d As Quincy Jones says, Meacham and McGraw have \u201cconvened a concert in Songs of America,\u201d one that reminds us of who we are, where we\u2019ve been, and what we, at our best, can be."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 9, "weeks_on_list": 8, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1627790438", "primary_isbn13": "9781627790437", "publisher": "Holt", "description": "The Pulitzer Prize-winning historian and journalist begins his Revolution Trilogy with events from 1775 to 1777.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The British Are Coming", "author": "Rick Atkinson", "contributor": "by Rick Atkinson", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781627790437.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/British-Are-Coming-Lexington-Revolution/dp/1627790438?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/books/review/rick-atkinson-the-british-are-coming.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1627790438", "isbn13": "9781627790437"}, {"isbn10": "1627790446", "isbn13": "9781627790444"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/British-Are-Coming-Lexington-Revolution/dp/1627790438?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781627790437?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781627790437"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BBRITISH%2BARE%2BCOMING%2FRick%2BAtkinson%2F9781627790437"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781627790437"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781627790437?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/d3bf23b2-ec5a-5e6d-9205-dcde27e8026f", "list_date": "2019/07/28", "published_data": "2019-05-14", "summary": "From the bestselling author of the Liberation Trilogy comes the extraordinary first volume of his new trilogy about the American Revolution Rick Atkinson, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning An Army at Dawn and two other superb books about World War II, has long been admired for his deeply researched, stunningly vivid narrative histories. Now he turns his attention to a new war, and in the initial volume of the Revolution Trilogy he recounts the first twenty-one months of America\u2019s violent war for independence. From the battles at Lexington and Concord in spring 1775 to those at Trenton and Princeton in winter 1777, American militiamen and then the ragged Continental Army take on the world\u2019s most formidable fighting force. It is a gripping saga alive with astonishing characters: Henry Knox, the former bookseller with an uncanny understanding of artillery; Nathanael Greene, the blue-eyed bumpkin who becomes a brilliant battle captain; Benjamin Franklin, the self-made man who proves to be the wiliest of diplomats; George Washington, the commander in chief who learns the difficult art of leadership when the war seems all but lost. The story is also told from the British perspective, making the mortal conflict between the redcoats and the rebels all the more compelling. Full of riveting details and untold stories, The British Are Coming is a tale of heroes and knaves, of sacrifice and blunder, of redemption and profound suffering. Rick Atkinson has given stirring new life to the first act of our country\u2019s creation drama."}, {"rank": 6, "rank_last_week": 11, "weeks_on_list": 8, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1501194291", "primary_isbn13": "9781501194290", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "description": "The radio interviewer delves into some of his favorite on-air conversations from the past four decades of his career.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Howard Stern Comes Again", "author": "Howard Stern", "contributor": "by Howard Stern", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781501194290.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 413, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Howard-Stern-Comes-Again/dp/1501194291?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/12/books/review-howard-stern-comes-again.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1501194291", "isbn13": "9781501194290"}, {"isbn10": "1501194313", "isbn13": "9781501194313"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Howard-Stern-Comes-Again/dp/1501194291?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781501194290?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781501194290"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FHOWARD%2BSTERN%2BCOMES%2BAGAIN%2FHoward%2BStern%2F9781501194290"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781501194290"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781501194290?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/3f6b1b1a-db34-5d56-9a46-15dccdcdb6dd", "list_date": "2019/07/21", "published_data": "2019-05-14", "summary": "Presents the first book in more than twenty years from the self-proclaimed King of All Media."}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 6, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0525533982", "primary_isbn13": "9780525533986", "publisher": "Blue Rider", "description": "A memoir by the professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors and 2012 N.B.A. All-Star.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Sixth Man", "author": "Andre Iguodala with Carvell Wallace", "contributor": "by Andre Iguodala with Carvell Wallace", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780525533986.jpg", "book_image_width": 326, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Sixth-Man-Memoir-Andre-Iguodala/dp/0525533982?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0525533982", "isbn13": "9780525533986"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Sixth-Man-Memoir-Andre-Iguodala/dp/0525533982?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780525533986?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780525533986"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BSIXTH%2BMAN%2FAndre%2BIguodala%2Bwith%2BCarvell%2BWallace%2F9780525533986"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780525533986"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780525533986?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/72145aa3-3fbe-52f7-bb6c-898cca007831", "list_date": "2019/07/21", "published_data": "2019-06-25", "summary": "**The Instant National Bestseller** The standout memoir from NBA powerhouse Andre Iguodala, the indomitable sixth man of the Golden State Warriors. Fresh off the Warriors\u2019 fourth Finals win in eight years, Andre Iguodala long has been one of the most admired players in the NBA. Off the court, Iguodala has earned respect, too\u2014for his successful tech investments, his philanthropy, and increasingly for his contributions to the conversation about race in America. It is no surprise, then, that in his first book, Andre, with his cowriter Carvell Wallace, has pushed himself to go further than he ever has before about his life, not only as an athlete but about what makes him who he is at his core. The Sixth Man traces Andre\u2019s journey from childhood in his Illinois hometown to his Bay Area home court today. Basketball has always been there. But this is the story, too, of his experience of the conflict and racial tension always at hand in a professional league made up largely of African American men; of whether and why the athlete owes the total sacrifice of his body; of the relationship between competition and brotherhood among the players of one of history\u2019s most glorious championship teams. And of what motivates an athlete to keep striving for more once they\u2019ve already achieved the highest level of play they could have dreamed. On drive, on leadership, on pain, on accomplishment, on the shame of being given a role, and the glory of taking a role on: This is a powerful memoir of life and basketball that reveals new depths to the superstar athlete, and offers tremendous insight into most urgent stories being told in American society today."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "None", "primary_isbn13": "9780698191068", "publisher": "Viking", "description": "How the F.B.I. caught Israel Keyes, a serial killer who, for 14 years, attacked victims across the country and returned to his quiet life in Alaska.", "price": "0.00", "title": "American Predator", "author": "Maureen Callahan", "contributor": "by Maureen Callahan", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780525428640.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/American-Predator-Meticulous-Serial-Century/dp/052542864X?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "052542864X", "isbn13": "9780525428640"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/American-Predator-Meticulous-Serial-Century/dp/052542864X?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780698191068?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780698191068"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FAMERICAN%2BPREDATOR%2FMaureen%2BCallahan%2F9780698191068"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780698191068"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780698191068?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/9fcb064e-cc5c-51f5-bd5c-bd65638d39ff", "list_date": "2019/07/21"}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 9, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0062880101", "primary_isbn13": "9780062880109", "publisher": "Morrow", "description": "The MSNBC host gives her analysis of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Man Who Sold America", "author": "Joy-Ann Reid", "contributor": "by Joy-Ann Reid", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780062880109.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Sold-America-Unraveling/dp/0062880101?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0062880101", "isbn13": "9780062880109"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Sold-America-Unraveling/dp/0062880101?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780062880109?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780062880109"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BMAN%2BWHO%2BSOLD%2BAMERICA%2FJoy-Ann%2BReid%2F9780062880109"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780062880109"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062880109?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/fe3eac2d-fe6f-5b1a-94cb-8a909ae2bae9", "list_date": "2019/07/21", "published_data": "2019-06-25", "summary": "Joy-Ann Reid, the host of MSNBC\u2019s AM Joy, assesses the Trump presidency in this urgent and deeply reported analysis of our national crisis."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 11, "weeks_on_list": 6, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1538729741", "primary_isbn13": "9781538729748", "publisher": "Grand Central", "description": "A memoir by the retired four-star Navy admiral, including the capture of Saddam Hussein and the raid to kill Osama bin Laden.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Sea Stories", "author": "William H McRaven", "contributor": "by William H.

Sea Stories begins in 1960 at the American Officers' Club in France, where Allied officers and their wives gathered to have drinks and tell stories about their adventures during World War II -- the place where a young Bill McRaven learned the value of a good story. Sea Stories is an unforgettable look back on one man's incredible life, from childhood days sneaking into high-security military sites to a day job of hunting terrorists and rescuing hostages. Action-packed, inspiring, and full of thrilling stories from life in the special operations world, Sea Stories is a remarkable memoir from one of America's most accomplished leaders."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "150113079X", "primary_isbn13": "9781501130793", "publisher": "Scribner", "description": "Dr. Eger recounts her life and survivor\u2019s guilt during and after her imprisonment in Auschwitz.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Choice", "author": "Edith Eva Eger", "contributor": "by Edith Eva Eger", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781501130793.jpg", "book_image_width": 325, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Choice-Dr-Edith-Eva-Eger/dp/150113079X?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/books/review/the-choice-edith-eva-eger-auschwitz-memoir.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "150113079X", "isbn13": "9781501130793"}, {"isbn10": "1501130811", "isbn13": "9781501130816"}, {"isbn10": "1501130781", "isbn13": "9781501130786"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Choice-Dr-Edith-Eva-Eger/dp/150113079X?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781501130793?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781501130793"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BCHOICE%2FEdith%2BEva%2BEger%2F9781501130793"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781501130793"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781501130793?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/f3ee5f6f-37e1-5878-9df4-3f48cf338572", "list_date": "2019/07/07", "published_data": "2018-09-04", "summary": "A New York Times Bestseller \u201cI\u2019ll be forever changed by Dr. Eger\u2019s story\u2026The Choice is a reminder of what courage looks like in the worst of times and that we all have the ability to pay attention to what we\u2019ve lost, or to pay attention to what we still have.\u201d\u2014Oprah \u201cDr. Eger\u2019s life reveals our capacity to transcend even the greatest of horrors and to use that suffering for the benefit of others.

In Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign against what he calls \u201cFake News,\u201d CNN Chief White House Correspondent, Jim Acosta, is public enemy number one. From the moment Mr. Trump announced his candidacy in 2015, he has attacked the media, calling journalists \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201d Acosta presents a damning examination of bureaucratic dysfunction, deception, and the unprecedented threat the rhetoric Mr. Trump is directing has on our democracy. When the leader of the free world incites hate and violence, Acosta doesn\u2019t back down, and he urges his fellow citizens to do the same. At Mr. Trump\u2019s most hated network, CNN, Acosta offers a never-before-reported account of what it\u2019s like to be the President\u2019s most hated correspondent. Acosta goes head-to-head with the White House, even after Trump supporters have threatened his life with words as well as physical violence. From the hazy denials and accusations meant to discredit the Mueller investigation, to the president\u2019s scurrilous tweets, Jim Acosta is in the eye of the storm while reporting live to millions of people across the world. After spending hundreds of hours with the revolving door of White House personnel, Acosta paints portraits of the personalities of Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Stephen Miller, Steve Bannon, Sean Spicer, Hope Hicks, Jared Kushner and more.

For more than four decades, George F. Will has attempted to discern the principles of the Western political tradition and apply them to America's civic life. Today, the stakes could hardly be higher. Vital questions about the nature of man, of rights, of equality, of majority rule are bubbling just beneath the surface of daily events in America. The Founders' vision, articulated first in the Declaration of Independence and carried out in the Constitution, gave the new republic a framework for government unique in world history. Their beliefs in natural rights, limited government, religious freedom, and in human virtue and dignity ushered in two centuries of American prosperity. Now, as Will shows, conservatism is under threat--both from progressives and elements inside the Republican Party. America has become an administrative state, while destructive trends have overtaken family life and higher education. Semi-autonomous executive agencies wield essentially unaccountable power. Congress has failed in its duty to exercise its legislative powers. And the executive branch has slipped the Constitution's leash. In the intellectual battle between the vision of Founding Fathers like James Madison, who advanced the notion of natural rights that pre-exist government, and the progressivism advanced by Woodrow Wilson, the Founders have been losing. It's time to reverse America's political fortunes. Expansive, intellectually thrilling, and written with the erudite wit that has made Will beloved by millions of readers, The Conservative Sensibility is an extraordinary new book from one of America's most celebrated political writers."}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 9, "weeks_on_list": 7, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0812993268", "primary_isbn13": "9780812993264", "publisher": "Random House", "description": "A New York Times Op-Ed columnist espouses having an outward focus to attain a meaningful life.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Second Mountain", "author": "David Brooks", "contributor": "by David Brooks", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780812993264.jpg", "book_image_width": 323, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Second-Mountain-Quest-Moral-Life/dp/0812993268?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/01/books/review/david-brooks-second-mountain.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0812993268", "isbn13": "9780812993264"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Second-Mountain-Quest-Moral-Life/dp/0812993268?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780812993264?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780812993264"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BSECOND%2BMOUNTAIN%2FDavid%2BBrooks%2F9780812993264"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780812993264"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780812993264?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/80785138-078a-5211-bfb6-9e87d45bd05a", "list_date": "2019/06/16", "published_data": "2019-04-16", "summary": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 Everybody tells you to live for a cause larger than yourself, but how exactly do you do it? The author of The Road to Character explores what it takes to lead a meaningful life in a self-centered world. \u201cDeeply moving, frequently eloquent and extraordinarily incisive.\u201d\u2014The Washington Post Every so often, you meet people who radiate joy\u2014who seem to know why they were put on this earth, who glow with a kind of inner light. Life, for these people, has often followed what we might think of as a two-mountain shape. They get out of school, they start a career, and they begin climbing the mountain they thought they were meant to climb. Their goals on this first mountain are the ones our culture endorses: to be a success, to make your mark, to experience personal happiness. But when they get to the top of that mountain, something happens. They look around and find the view . . . unsatisfying. They realize: This wasn\u2019t my mountain after all. There\u2019s another, bigger mountain out there that is actually my mountain. And so they embark on a new journey. On the second mountain, life moves from self-centered to other-centered. They want the things that are truly worth wanting, not the things other people tell them to want. They embrace a life of interdependence, not independence. They surrender to a life of commitment. In The Second Mountain, David Brooks explores the four commitments that define a life of meaning and purpose: to a spouse and family, to a vocation, to a philosophy or faith, and to a community. Our personal fulfillment depends on how well we choose and execute these commitments. Brooks looks at a range of people who have lived joyous, committed lives, and who have embraced the necessity and beauty of dependence. He gathers their wisdom on how to choose a partner, how to pick a vocation, how to live out a philosophy, and how we can begin to integrate our commitments into one overriding purpose. In short, this book is meant to help us all lead more meaningful lives. But it\u2019s also a provocative social commentary. We live in a society, Brooks argues, that celebrates freedom, that tells us to be true to ourselves, at the expense of surrendering to a cause, rooting ourselves in a neighborhood, binding ourselves to others by social solidarity and love. We have taken individualism to the extreme\u2014and in the process we have torn the social fabric in a thousand different ways. The path to repair is through making deeper commitments. In The Second Mountain, Brooks shows what can happen when we put commitment-making at the center of our lives."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 8, "weeks_on_list": 4, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1101947861", "primary_isbn13": "9781101947869", "publisher": "Knopf", "description": "Harper Lee\u2019s work on the true-crime story about a rural preacher accused of murdering five of his family members in the 1970s.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Furious Hours", "author": "Casey Cep", "contributor": "by Casey Cep", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781101947869.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 491, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Furious-Hours-Murder-Fraud-Harper/dp/1101947861?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/books/review/casey-cep-furious-hours-harper-lee.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1101947861", "isbn13": "9781101947869"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Furious-Hours-Murder-Fraud-Harper/dp/1101947861?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781101947869?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781101947869"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FFURIOUS%2BHOURS%2FCasey%2BCep%2F9781101947869"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781101947869"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781101947869?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/e1ad371e-a562-54fb-a10f-c5b39a042e22", "list_date": "2019/06/16", "published_data": "2019", "summary": "\"This is a Borzoi book published by Alfred A.

Cotton was a platoon leader with the storied 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment\u2014The Old Guard\u2014between combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. At the height of the Iraq Surge, he carried the flag-draped remains of his fallen comrades off of airplanes at Dover Air Force Base, and he laid them to rest in Arlington\u2019s famed Section 60, \u201cthe saddest acre in America.\u201d He also performed hundreds of funerals for veterans of the Greatest Generation, as well as the Korean and Vietnam Wars.

Every funeral is a no-fail, zero-defect mission, whether honoring a legendary general or a humble private.

It is by turns amusing and alarming.\" -- The New Yorker \"Golf is the spine of this shocking, wildly humorous book, but humanity is its flesh and spirit.\" -- Chicago Sun-Times \"Every one of Trump's most disgusting qualities surfaces in golf.\" -- The Ringer An outrageous indictment of Donald Trump's appalling behavior when it comes to golf -- on and off the green -- and what it reveals about his character. Donald Trump loves golf. He loves to play it, buy it, build it, and operate it. He owns 14 courses around the world and runs another five, all of which he insists are the best on the planet. He also claims he's a 3 handicap, almost never loses, and has won an astonishing 18 club championships. How much of all that is true? Almost none of it, acclaimed sportswriter Rick Reilly reveals in this unsparing look at Trump in the world of golf. Based on Reilly's own experiences with Trump as well as interviews with over 100 golf pros, amateurs, developers, and caddies, Commander in Cheat is a startling and at times hilarious indictment of Trump and his golf game. You'll learn how Trump cheats (sometimes with the help of his caddies and Secret Service agents), lies about his scores (the \"Trump Bump\"), tells whoppers about the rank of his courses and their worth (declaring that every one of them is worth $50 million), and tramples the etiquette of the game (driving on greens doesn't help). Trump doesn't brag so much, though, about the golf contractors he stiffs, the course neighbors he intimidates, or the way his golf decisions wind up infecting his political ones. For Trump, it's always about winning. To do it, he uses the tricks he picked up from the hustlers at the public course where he learned the game as a college kid, and then polished as one of the most bombastic businessmen of our time. As Reilly writes, \"Golf is like bicycle shorts. It reveals a lot about a man.\" Commander in Cheat \"paints a side-splitting portrait of a congenital cheater\" (Esquire), revealing all kinds of unsightly truths Trump has been hiding."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 12, "weeks_on_list": 6, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0525511776", "primary_isbn13": "9780525511779", "publisher": "Spiegel & Grau", "description": "The comedian chronicles going into therapy and becoming an advocate for change.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Life Will Be The Death Of Me", "author": "Chelsea Handler", "contributor": "by Chelsea Handler", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780525511779.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Life-Will-Be-Death-Me/dp/0525511776?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0525511776", "isbn13": "9780525511779"}, {"isbn10": "0525511784", "isbn13": "9780525511786"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Life-Will-Be-Death-Me/dp/0525511776?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780525511779?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780525511779"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FLIFE%2BWILL%2BBE%2BTHE%2BDEATH%2BOF%2BME%2FChelsea%2BHandler%2F9780525511779"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780525511779"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780525511779?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/17025568-9240-5202-a283-50a002dadb72", "list_date": "2019/06/02", "published_data": "2019-04-09", "summary": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 The funny, sad, super-honest, all-true story of Chelsea Handler\u2019s year of self-discovery\u2014featuring a nerdily brilliant psychiatrist, a shaman, four Chow Chows, some well-placed security cameras, various family members (living and departed), friends, assistants, and a lot of edibles A SKIMM READS PICK \u2022 \u201cThis will be one of your favorite books of all time.\u201d\u2014Amy Schumer In a haze of vape smoke on a rare windy night in L.A. in the fall of 2016, Chelsea Handler daydreams about what life will be like with a woman in the White House.

Now I know.\u201d\u2014Ellen DeGeneres \u201cI love this book not just because it made me laugh or because I learned that I feel the same way about certain people in politics as Chelsea does. I love this book because I feel like I finally really got to know Chelsea Handler after all these years.

Before there was \"tourism\" and souvenir ashtrays became \"kitsch,\" the Lake of the Ozarks was a Shangri-La for middle-class Midwestern families on vacation, complete with man-made beaches, Hillbilly Mini Golf, and feathered rubber tomahawks. It was there that author Bill Geist spent summers in the Sixties during his school and college years working at Arrowhead Lodge-a small resort owned by his bombastic uncle-in all areas of the operation, from cesspool attendant to bellhop. What may have seemed just a summer job became, upon reflection, a transformative era where a cast of eccentric, small-town characters and experiences shaped (some might suggest \"slightly twisted\") Bill into the man he is today. He realized it was this time in his life that had a direct influence on his sensibilities, his humor, his writing, and ultimately a career searching the world for other such untamed creatures for the Chicago Tribune, the New York Times, and CBS News. In Lake of the Ozarks, Emmy Award-winning CBS Sunday Morning Correspondent Bill Geist reflects on his coming of age in the American Heartland and traces his evolution as a man and a writer. He shares laugh-out-loud anecdotes and tongue-in-cheek observations guaranteed to evoke a strong sense of nostalgia for \"the good ol' days.\" Written with Geistian wit and warmth, Lake of the Ozarks takes readers back to a bygone era, and demonstrates how you can find inspiration in the most unexpected places."}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "None", "primary_isbn13": "9780718022136", "publisher": "Thomas Nelson", "description": "The late author's pursuit of a renewed faith in the community and her misgivings about organized religion.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Searching For Sunday", "author": "Rachel Held Evans", "contributor": "by Rachel Held Evans", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780718022136.jpg", "book_image_width": 325, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "http://www.amazon.com/Searching-Sunday-Loving-Leaving-Finding-ebook/dp/B00PWOH2CI?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0718022122", "isbn13": "9780718022129"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "http://www.amazon.com/Searching-Sunday-Loving-Leaving-Finding-ebook/dp/B00PWOH2CI?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780718022136?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780718022136"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FSEARCHING%2BFOR%2BSUNDAY%2FRachel%2BHeld%2BEvans%2F9780718022136"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780718022136"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780718022136?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/01ab0013-13ae-5d7c-b5d4-7abe013f9802", "list_date": "2019/05/26"}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1982113472", "primary_isbn13": "9781982113476", "publisher": "Atria", "description": "The star of \u201cMythBusters\u201d shares his tools for creativity.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Every Tool'S A Hammer", "author": "Adam Savage", "contributor": "by Adam Savage", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781982113476.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Every-Tools-Hammer-Life-What/dp/1982113472?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1982113472", "isbn13": "9781982113476"}, {"isbn10": "1982113499", "isbn13": "9781982113490"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Every-Tools-Hammer-Life-What/dp/1982113472?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781982113476?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781982113476"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FEVERY%2BTOOL%2527S%2BA%2BHAMMER%2FAdam%2BSavage%2F9781982113476"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781982113476"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781982113476?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/7a33c015-497f-5883-9564-934bacf3f4d9", "list_date": "2019/05/26", "published_data": "2019-05-07", "summary": "A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u201cAn imperative how-to for creativity.\u201d \u2014Nick Offerman Adam Savage\u2014star of Discovery Channel\u2019s Mythbusters and one of the most beloved figures in science and tech\u2014shares his golden rules of creativity, from finding inspiration to following through and successfully making your idea a reality. Every Tool\u2019s a Hammer is a chronicle of my life as a maker. It\u2019s an exploration of making and of my own productive obsessions, but it\u2019s also a permission slip of sorts from me to you. Permission to grab hold of the things you\u2019re interested in, that fascinate you, and to dive deeper into them to see where they lead you. Through stories from forty-plus years of making and molding, building and break\u00ading, along with the lessons I learned along the way, this book is meant to be a toolbox of problem solving, complete with a shop\u2019s worth of notes on the tools, techniques, and materials that I use most often. Things like: In Every Tool There Is a Hammer\u2014don\u2019t wait until everything is perfect to begin a project, and if you don\u2019t have the exact right tool for a task, just use whatever\u2019s handy; Increase Your Loose Tolerance\u2014making is messy and filled with screwups, but that\u2019s okay, as creativity is a path with twists and turns and not a straight line to be found; Use More Cooling Fluid\u2014it prolongs the life of blades and bits, and it prevents tool failure, but beyond that it\u2019s a reminder to slow down and reduce the fric\u00adtion in your work and relationships; Screw Before You Glue\u2014mechanical fasteners allow you to change and modify a project while glue is forever but sometimes you just need the right glue, so I dig into which ones will do the job with the least harm and best effects. This toolbox also includes lessons from many other incredible makers and creators, including: Jamie Hyneman, Nick Offerman, Pixar director Andrew Stanton, Oscar-winner Guillermo del Toro, artist Tom Sachs, and chef Traci Des Jardins. And if everything goes well, we will hopefully save you a few mistakes (and maybe fingers) as well as help you turn your curiosities into creations. I hope this book inspires you to build, make, invent, explore, and\u2014most of all\u2014enjoy the thrills of being a creator."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1250182328", "primary_isbn13": "9781250182326", "publisher": "Flatiron", "description": "The former second lady\u2019s challenges in being a mother, educator and political spouse.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Where The Light Enters", "author": "Jill Biden", "contributor": "by Jill Biden", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781250182326.jpg", "book_image_width": 321, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Where-Light-Enters-Building-Discovering/dp/1250182328?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1250182328", "isbn13": "9781250182326"}, {"isbn10": "1250182336", "isbn13": "9781250182333"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Where-Light-Enters-Building-Discovering/dp/1250182328?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781250182326?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781250182326"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FWHERE%2BTHE%2BLIGHT%2BENTERS%2FJill%2BBiden%2F9781250182326"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781250182326"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250182326?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/47cae789-e15a-5484-a44e-2da1550927a3", "list_date": "2019/05/26", "published_data": "2019-05-07", "summary": "An intimate look at the traditions, resilience, and love that built the Biden family, and the delicate balancing act of the woman at its center. Growing up, Jill Biden wanted two things: a marriage like her parents\u2019 and a career. But her journey to fulfill those wishes would take unexpected turns, and her definition of family would be challenged again and again. After an early heartbreak, Jill was unsure what the future would hold. Then she met Joe Biden, Delaware\u2019s junior senator, who was grieving the loss of his wife and daughter while raising his two young sons. As they fell in love, Jill faced difficult questions: was she willing to commit to marriage? How would politics shape her family life\u2014and her career? And could she become a mother to these boys? This is the story of how Jill built a family of her own: from seeking small moments of joy, to balancing the family\u2019s needs with her personal and professional goals, to forming traditions that helped carry them through tragedy\u2014all with the support of an extended family circle. That circle would morph over the years, but the one constant was love. And whether finding her own voice as Second Lady or changing lives as a teacher, whether nurturing the Biden clan or surviving devastating loss, Jill discovered her own strength and came to understand what it truly means to make a family. WHERE THE LIGHT ENTERS is a deeply personal exploration of the love that defines family in its many forms. It is a brave and vulnerable glimpse into the creation of a beloved American family, and the life of the woman at its center."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0399588396", "primary_isbn13": "9780399588396", "publisher": "Random House", "description": "A dozen essays based on short phrases that have defined some of the memoir writer's close relationships.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Tell Me More", "author": "Kelly Corrigan", "contributor": "by Kelly Corrigan", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780399588372.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 494, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Tell-Me-More-Stories-Learning/dp/039958837X?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "039958837X", "isbn13": "9780399588372"}, {"isbn10": "0399588396", "isbn13": "9780399588396"}, {"isbn10": "0399588388", "isbn13": "9780399588389"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Tell-Me-More-Stories-Learning/dp/039958837X?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780399588396?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780399588396"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTELL%2BME%2BMORE%2FKelly%2BCorrigan%2F9780399588396"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780399588396"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780399588396?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/973552e5-c703-5c52-b393-94b49374aff7", "list_date": "2019/05/19", "published_data": "2019-04-30", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 A story-driven collection of essays on the twelve powerful phrases we use to sustain our relationships, from the bestselling author of Glitter and Glue and The Middle Place \u201cKelly Corrigan takes on all the big, difficult questions here, with great warmth and courage.\u201d\u2014Glennon Doyle NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY REAL SIMPLE AND BUSTLE It\u2019s a crazy idea: trying to name the phrases that make love and connection possible. But that\u2019s just what Kelly Corrigan has set out to do here. In her New York Times bestselling memoirs, Corrigan distilled our core relationships to their essences, showcasing a warm, easy storytelling style. Now, in Tell Me More, she\u2019s back with a deeply personal, unfailingly honest, and often hilarious examination of the essential phrases that turn the wheel of life. In \u201cI Don\u2019t Know,\u201d Corrigan wrestles to make peace with uncertainty, whether it\u2019s over invitations that never came or a friend\u2019s agonizing infertility. In \u201cNo,\u201d she admires her mother\u2019s ability to set boundaries and her liberating willingness to be unpopular. In \u201cTell Me More,\u201d a facialist named Tish teaches her something important about listening. And in \u201cI Was Wrong,\u201d she comes clean about her disastrous role in a family fight\u2014and explains why saying sorry may not be enough. With refreshing candor, a deep well of empathy, and her signature desire to understand \u201cthe thing behind the thing,\u201d Corrigan swings between meditations on life with a preoccupied husband and two mercurial teenage daughters to profound observations on love and loss. With the streetwise, ever-relatable voice that defines Corrigan\u2019s work, Tell Me More is a moving and meaningful take on the power of the right words at the right moment to change everything. Praise for Tell Me More \u201cIt is such a comfort just knowing that Kelly Corrigan exists: she is somehow both wise and self-deprecating; funny but unafraid of pain; frank but gentle. She is the sister/mother/best friend we all wish we could have\u2014and because of this big-hearted book, we all get to.\u201d\u2014Ariel Levy, author of The Rules Do Not Apply \u201cWith full-bodied humor and radical sensitivity, Kelly Corrigan transforms the mundane pain of life into a necessary spiritual text of sorts, one that reminds us that we have the right to grieve but the obligation to be grateful.

This is a 9/11 book like no other. Masterfully weaving together multiple strands of the events in New York, at the Pentagon, and in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, Fall and Rise is a mesmerizing, minute-by-minute account of that terrible day. In the days and months after 9/11, Mitchell Zuckoff, then a reporter for the Boston Globe, wrote about the attacks, the victims, and their families. After further years of meticulous reporting, Zuckoff has filled Fall and Rise with voices of the lost and the saved. The result is an utterly gripping book, filled with intimate stories of people most affected by the events of that sunny Tuesday in September: an out-of-work actor stuck in an elevator in the North Tower of the World Trade Center; the heroes aboard Flight 93 deciding to take action; a veteran trapped in the inferno in the Pentagon; the fire chief among the first on the scene in sleepy Shanksville; a team of firefighters racing to save an injured woman and themselves; and the men, women, and children flying across country to see loved ones or for work who suddenly faced terrorists bent on murder. Fall and Rise will open new avenues of understanding for everyone who thinks they know the story of 9/11, bringing to life\u2014and in some cases, bringing back to life\u2014the extraordinary ordinary people who experienced the worst day in modern American history. Destined to be a classic, Fall and Rise will move, shock, inspire, and fill hearts with love and admiration for the human spirit as it triumphs in the face of horrifying events."}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1250243734", "primary_isbn13": "9781250153739", "publisher": "St. Martin's", "description": "The author of \u201cMagicians of the Gods\u201d makes his case about the origins of civilizations.", "price": "0.00", "title": "America Before", "author": "Graham Hancock", "contributor": "by Graham Hancock", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781250153739.jpg", "book_image_width": 325, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/America-Before-Earths-Lost-Civilization/dp/1250153735?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1250243734", "isbn13": "9781250153739"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/America-Before-Earths-Lost-Civilization/dp/1250153735?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781250153739?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781250153739"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FAMERICA%2BBEFORE%2FGraham%2BHancock%2F9781250153739"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781250153739"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250153739?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/7c8a0b13-1840-51e9-94ac-eb93bcb2ac93", "list_date": "2019/05/12", "published_data": "2019", "summary": "\"Was an advanced civilization lost to history in the global cataclysm that ended the last Ice Age? Graham Hancock, the internationally bestselling author, has made it his life's work to find out--and in [this book], he draws on the latest archaeological and DNA evidence to bring his quest to a stunning conclusion. We've been taught that North and South America were empty of humans until around 13,000 years ago--amongst the last great landmasses on earth to have been settled by our ancestors. But new discoveries have radically reshaped this long-established picture and we know now that the Americas were first peopled more than 130,000 years ago--many tens of thousands of years before human settlements became established elsewhere. Hancock's research takes us on a series of journeys and encounters with the scientists responsible for the recent extraordinary breakthroughs. In the process, from the Mississippi Valley to the Amazon rainforest, he reveals that ancient 'New World' cultures share a legacy of advanced scientific knowledge and sophisticated spiritual beliefs with supposedly unconnected 'Old World' cultures. Have archaeologists focused for too long only on the 'Old World' in their search for the origins of civilization while failing to consider the revolutionary possibility that those origins might in fact be found in the 'New World'? [This book] is the culmination of everything that millions of readers have loved in Hancock's body of work over the past decades, namely a mind-dilating exploration of the mysteries of the past, amazing archaeological discoveries and profound implications for how we lead our lives today.\"--Provided by publisher."}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 8, "weeks_on_list": 4, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1538713640", "primary_isbn13": "9781538713648", "publisher": "Twelve", "description": "A biography of the former first lady Barbara Bush, based on interviews and her private diaries.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Matriarch", "author": "Susan Page", "contributor": "by Susan Page", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781538713648.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Matriarch-Barbara-Making-American-Dynasty/dp/1538713640?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1538713640", "isbn13": "9781538713648"}, {"isbn10": "153871552X", "isbn13": "9781538715529"}, {"isbn10": "1538713659", "isbn13": "9781538713655"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Matriarch-Barbara-Making-American-Dynasty/dp/1538713640?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781538713648?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781538713648"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BMATRIARCH%2FSusan%2BPage%2F9781538713648"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781538713648"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781538713648?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/ea0412c6-c89a-5cb9-b731-3bd4ad2a3a22", "list_date": "2019/05/12", "published_data": "2019-04-02", "summary": "INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \"[The] rare biography of a public figure that's not only beautifully written, but also shockingly revelatory.\" -- The Atlantic A vivid biography of former First Lady Barbara Bush, one of the most influential and under-appreciated women in American political history. Barbara Pierce Bush was one of the country's most popular and powerful figures, yet her full story has never been told. THE MATRIARCH tells the riveting tale of a woman who helped define two American presidencies and an entire political era. Written by USA TODAY's Washington Bureau chief Susan Page, this biography is informed by more than one hundred interviews with Bush friends and family members, hours of conversation with Mrs. Bush herself in the final six months of her life, and access to her diaries that spanned decades. THE MATRIARCH examines not only her public persona but also less well-known aspects of her remarkable life. As a girl in Rye, New York, Barbara Bush weathered criticism of her weight from her mother, barbs that left lifelong scars. As a young wife, she coped with the death of her three-year-old daughter from leukemia, a loss that changed her forever. In middle age, she grappled with depression so serious that she contemplated suicide. And as first the wife and then the mother of American presidents, she made history as the only woman to see -- and advise -- both her husband and son in the Oval Office. As with many women of her era, Barbara Bush was routinely underestimated, her contributions often neither recognized nor acknowledged. But she became an astute and trusted political campaign strategist and a beloved First Lady. She invested herself deeply in expanding literacy programs in America, played a critical role in the end of the Cold War, and led the way in demonstrating love and compassion to those with HIV/AIDS. With her cooperation, this book offers Barbara Bush's last words for history -- on the evolution of her party, on the role of women, on Donald Trump, and on her family's legacy. Barbara Bush's accomplishments, struggles, and contributions are many. Now, Susan Page explores them all in THE MATRIARCH, a groundbreaking book certain to cement Barbara Bush as one of the most unique and influential women in American history."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0812996100", "primary_isbn13": "9780812996104", "publisher": "Random House", "description": "The Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist observes the joys of being a grandmother.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Nanaville", "author": "Anna Quindlen", "contributor": "by Anna Quindlen", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780812996104.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 484, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Nanaville-Adventures-Grandparenting-Anna-Quindlen/dp/0812996100?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/books/review/nanaville-anna-quindlen.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0812996100", "isbn13": "9780812996104"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Nanaville-Adventures-Grandparenting-Anna-Quindlen/dp/0812996100?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780812996104?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780812996104"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FNANAVILLE%2FAnna%2BQuindlen%2F9780812996104"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780812996104"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780812996104?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/1146861d-3ba0-57dd-88af-4a6e0e6db1ac", "list_date": "2019/05/12", "published_data": "2019-04-23", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 The perfect gift for new parents and grandparents this Mother\u2019s Day: a bighearted book of wisdom, wit, and insight, celebrating the love and joy of being a grandmother, from the Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning columnist and #1 bestselling author \u201cThis tender book should be required reading for grandparents everywhere.\u201d\u2014Booklist (starred review) \u201cI am changing his diaper, he is kicking and complaining, his exhausted father has gone to the kitchen for a glass of water, his exhausted mother is prone on the couch.

Once described by the Washington Post as \u201cthe most interesting mayor you\u2019ve never heard of,\u201d Pete Buttigieg, the thirty-seven-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has now emerged as one of the nation\u2019s most visionary politicians. With soaring prose that celebrates a resurgent American Midwest, Shortest Way Home narrates the heroic transformation of a \u201cdying city\u201d (Newsweek) into nothing less than a shining model of urban reinvention. Interweaving two narratives\u2014that of a young man coming of age and a town regaining its economic vitality\u2014Buttigieg recounts growing up in a Rust Belt city, amid decayed factory buildings and the steady soundtrack of rumbling freight trains passing through on their long journey to Chicagoland. Inspired by John F. Kennedy\u2019s legacy, Buttigieg first left northern Indiana for red-bricked Harvard and then studied at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, before joining McKinsey, where he trained as a consultant\u2014becoming, of all things, an expert in grocery pricing. Then, Buttigieg defied the expectations that came with his pedigree, choosing to return home to Indiana and responding to the ultimate challenge of how to revive a once-great industrial city and help steer its future in the twenty-first century. Elected at twenty-nine as the nation\u2019s youngest mayor, Pete Buttigieg immediately recognized that \u201cgreat cities, and even great nations, are built through attention to the everyday.\u201d As Shortest Way Home recalls, the challenges were daunting\u2014whether confronting gun violence, renaming a street in honor of Martin Luther King Jr., or attracting tech companies to a city that had appealed more to junk bond scavengers than serious investors. None of this is underscored more than Buttigieg\u2019s audacious campaign to reclaim 1,000 houses, many of them abandoned, in 1,000 days and then, even as a sitting mayor, deploying to serve in Afghanistan as a Navy officer.

He reconnects with old friends and tries to make new ones\u2014which turns out to be a struggle, because Lucy likes people a lot more than he does.

In 2016, Ben Shapiro spoke at UC Berkeley. Hundreds of police officers were required from 10 UC campuses across the state to protect his speech, which was -- ironically -- about the necessity for free speech and rational debate. He came to argue that Western Civilization is in the midst of a crisis of purpose and ideas. Our freedoms are built upon the twin notions that every human being is made in God\u2019s image and that human beings were created with reason capable of exploring God\u2019s world. We can thank these values for the birth of science, the dream of progress, human rights, prosperity, peace, and artistic beauty. Jerusalem and Athens built America, ended slavery, defeated the Nazis and the Communists, lifted billions from poverty and gave billions spiritual purpose. Jerusalem and Athens were the foundations of the Magna Carta and the Treaty of Westphalia; they were the foundations of Declaration of Independence, Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Emancipation Proclamation, and Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s Letter from Birmingham Jail. Civilizations that rejected Jerusalem and Athens have collapsed into dust. The USSR rejected Judeo-Christian values and Greek natural law, substituting a new utopian vision of \u201csocial justice\u201d \u2013 and they starved and slaughtered tens of millions of human beings. The Nazis rejected Judeo-Christian values and Greek natural law, and they shoved children into gas chambers. Venezuela rejects Judeo-Christian values and Greek natural law, and citizens of their oil-rich nation have been reduced to eating dogs. We are in the process of abandoning Judeo-Christian values and Greek natural law, favoring instead moral subjectivism and the rule of passion. And we are watching our civilization collapse into age-old tribalism, individualistic hedonism, and moral subjectivism. We believe we can reject Judeo-Christian values and Greek natural law and satisfy ourselves with intersectionality, or scientific materialism, or progressive politics, or authoritarian governance, or nationalistic solidarity. We can\u2019t. The West is special, and in The Right Side of History, Ben Shapiro bravely explains that it\u2019s because too many of us have lost sight of the moral purpose that drives us each to be better, or the sacred duty to work together for the greater good, or both. A stark warning, and a call to spiritual arms, this book may be the first step in getting our civilization back on track."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1250178266", "primary_isbn13": "9781250178268", "publisher": "Holt", "description": "How unchecked climate change, robotics and artificial intelligence threaten human existence.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Falter", "author": "Bill McKibben", "contributor": "by Bill McKibben", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781250178268.jpg", "book_image_width": 321, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Falter-Human-Game-Begun-Itself/dp/1250178266?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/books/review/bill-mckibben-falter.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1250178266", "isbn13": "9781250178268"}, {"isbn10": "1250178274", "isbn13": "9781250178275"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Falter-Human-Game-Begun-Itself/dp/1250178266?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781250178268?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781250178268"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FFALTER%2FBill%2BMcKibben%2F9781250178268"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781250178268"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250178268?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/2786a3d1-4c5c-56bf-afde-e7bce0d87972", "list_date": "2019/05/05", "published_data": "2019-04-16", "summary": "Thirty years ago Bill McKibben offered one of the earliest warnings about climate change.

Bill McKibben\u2019s groundbreaking book The End of Nature -- issued in dozens of languages and long regarded as a classic -- was the first book to alert us to global warming. But the danger is broader than that: even as climate change shrinks the space where our civilization can exist, new technologies like artificial intelligence and robotics threaten to bleach away the variety of human experience. Falter tells the story of these converging trends and of the ideological fervor that keeps us from bringing them under control. And then, drawing on McKibben\u2019s experience in building 350.org, the first truly global citizens movement to combat climate change, it offers some possible ways out of the trap. We\u2019re at a bleak moment in human history -- and we\u2019ll either confront that bleakness or watch the civilization our forebears built slip away.

Now in paperback, Robert Caro gives us a glimpse into his own life and work in these evocatively written, personal pieces. He describes what it was like to interview the mighty Robert Moses and to begin discovering the extent of the political power Moses wielded; the combination of discouragement and exhilaration he felt confronting the vast holdings of the Lyndon B. Johnson Library in Austin, Texas; his encounters with witnesses, including longtime residents wrenchingly displaced by the construction of Moses' Cross-Bronx Expressway and Lady Bird Johnson acknowledging the beauty and influence of one of LBJ's mistresses. He gratefully remembers how, after years of working in solitude, he found a writers' community at the New York Public Library, and details the ways he goes about planning and composing his books. Caro recalls the moments at which he came to understand that he wanted to write not just about the men who wielded power but about the people and the politics that were shaped by that power. And he talks about the importance to him of the writing itself, of how he tries to infuse it with a sense of place and mood to bring characters and situations to life on the page. Taken together, these reminiscences--some previously published, some written expressly for this book--bring into focus the passion, the wry self-deprecation, and the integrity with which this brilliant historian has always approached his work."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0525574743", "primary_isbn13": "9780525574743", "publisher": "Crown", "description": "A look at congressional gridlock and the first two years of Trump's presidency.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Hill To Die On", "author": "Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer", "contributor": "by Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780525574743.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Hill-Die-Battle-Congress-America/dp/0525574743?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0525574743", "isbn13": "9780525574743"}, {"isbn10": "052557476X", "isbn13": "9780525574767"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Hill-Die-Battle-Congress-America/dp/0525574743?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780525574743?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780525574743"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BHILL%2BTO%2BDIE%2BON%2FJake%2BSherman%2Band%2BAnna%2BPalmer%2F9780525574743"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780525574743"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780525574743?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/f477211b-aad5-55a0-8bda-5cb56f6f9516", "list_date": "2019/04/28", "published_data": "2019-04-09", "summary": "The startling inside story of Donald Trump's first two years in Washington as viewed from Capitol Hill, where lawmakers on both sides of the aisle jockeyed for advantage as American politics reached a fevered pitch.

Like The West Wing for Congress, or Shattered meets This Town, The Hill to Die On tells an unforgettable story of politics and power, where the stakes going forward are nothing less than the future of America and the lives of millions of ordinary Americans."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0399590013", "primary_isbn13": "9780399590016", "publisher": "Random House", "description": "Issues created by mass incarceration and our criminal justice system are explored through the cases of two young people.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Charged", "author": "Emily Bazelon", "contributor": "by Emily Bazelon", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780399590016.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Charged-Movement-Transform-Prosecution-Incarceration/dp/0399590013?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/books/review/emily-bazelon-charged.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0399590013", "isbn13": "9780399590016"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Charged-Movement-Transform-Prosecution-Incarceration/dp/0399590013?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780399590016?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780399590016"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FCHARGED%2FEmily%2BBazelon%2F9780399590016"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780399590016"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780399590016?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/e0268cbd-728d-52e3-8924-2fc4ea43bfb6", "list_date": "2019/04/28", "published_data": "2019-04-09", "summary": "A renowned journalist and legal commentator exposes the unchecked power of the prosecutor as a driving force in America's mass incarceration crisis--and charts a way out. \"An important, thoughtful and thorough examination of criminal justice in America that speaks directly to how we reduce mass incarceration.\"--Bryan Stevenson, author of Just Mercy The American criminal justice system is supposed to be a contest between two equal adversaries, the prosecution and the defense, with judges ensuring a fair fight. That image does not match the reality in the courtroom, however. Much of the time, it is prosecutors more than judges who control the outcome of a case. They answer to almost no one and make most of the key decisions, from choosing the charge to setting bail to determining the plea bargain. They often decide who goes free and who goes to prison, even who lives and who dies. The system wasn't designed for this kind of unchecked power, and in Charged, Emily Bazelon reveals how it is the underreported cause of enormous injustice--and the missing piece in the mass incarceration puzzle. Charged follows the story of two young people caught up in the criminal justice system: Kevin, a twenty-year-old in Brooklyn who picked up his friend's gun as the cops burst in and was charged with a serious violent felony, and Noura, a teenage girl in Memphis indicted for the murder of her mother. Bazelon tracks both cases, exploring every phase of the criminal justice process--from arrest and charging to trial and sentencing--and, with her trademark blend of deeply reported narrative, legal analysis, and investigative journalism, illustrates just how criminal prosecutions can go wrong and, more important, why they don't have to. Bazelon shows how prosecution in America is at a crossroads and details the damage overzealous prosecutors can do--and also the second chances they can extend, if they choose, to Kevin and Noura and so many others, allowing them to make things right in their own lives. She follows a wave of reform-minded D.A.s who have been elected in some of our biggest cities, as well as in rural areas in every region of the country, put in office to do nothing less than reinvent how their job is done. If they succeed, they can point the country toward a different and profoundly better future. In Charged, Emily Bazelon mounts a major critique of the American criminal justice system--and tells the story of the movement for change."}, {"rank": 9, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0525511350", "primary_isbn13": "9780525511359", "publisher": "Random House", "description": "After receiving a terminal cancer diagnosis, a lawyer and mother of two chronicles her life.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Unwinding Of The Miracle", "author": "Julie Yip-Williams", "contributor": "by Julie Yip-Williams", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780525511359.jpg", "book_image_width": 324, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Unwinding-Miracle-Memoir-Death-Everything/dp/0525511350?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/books/review/julie-yip-williams-unwinding-miracle.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0525511350", "isbn13": "9780525511359"}, {"isbn10": "0525511369", "isbn13": "9780525511366"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Unwinding-Miracle-Memoir-Death-Everything/dp/0525511350?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780525511359?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780525511359"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BUNWINDING%2BOF%2BTHE%2BMIRACLE%2FJulie%2BYip-Williams%2F9780525511359"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780525511359"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780525511359?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/b30d8be8-ea4b-5585-9350-1c8b748d9333", "list_date": "2019/04/21", "published_data": "2019", "summary": "\"Born blind in Vietnam, Julie Yip-Williams narrowly escaped euthanasia by her grandmother, only to then flee the political upheaval of the late 1970s with her family. Loaded into a rickety boat with three hundred other refugees, Julie made it to Hong Kong and, ultimately, America, where a surgeon at UCLA gave her partial sight. Against all odds, she became a Harvard-educated lawyer, with a husband, a family, a life. Then, at age thirty-seven, with two little girls at home, Julie was diagnosed with terminal metastatic colon cancer, and a different journey began. The Unwinding of the Miracle is the story of a vigorous life refracted through the prism of imminent death. Motherhood, marriage, ambition, love, wanderlust, tennis, grief, jealousy, anger, comfort, pain, disease--there is simply nothing this book is not about. Growing out of a blog Julie has kept through the past four years of her life (undertaken because she couldn't find the guidance she needed through her disease), this is the story of a life lived so well, and cut too short. It is inspiring and instructive, delightful and shattering. It is a book of indelible moments, seared deep. With glorious humor, beautiful and bracing honesty, and the cleansing power of well-deployed anger, Julie Yip-Williams has set the stage for her lasting legacy and one final miracle: the story of her life\"--"}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 5, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0525521127", "primary_isbn13": "9780525521129", "publisher": "Knopf", "description": "The former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York describes some of his career highlights and gives insights into our legal system.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Doing Justice", "author": "Preet Bharara", "contributor": "by Preet Bharara", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780525521129.jpg", "book_image_width": 302, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Doing-Justice-Prosecutors-Thoughts-Punishment/dp/0525521127?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/books/review/preet-bharara-doing-justice.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0525521127", "isbn13": "9780525521129"}, {"isbn10": "0525521135", "isbn13": "9780525521136"}, {"isbn10": "0525595767", "isbn13": "9780525595762"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Doing-Justice-Prosecutors-Thoughts-Punishment/dp/0525521127?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780525521129?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780525521129"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FDOING%2BJUSTICE%2FPreet%2BBharara%2F9780525521129"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780525521129"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780525521129?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/f4bd675f-d116-57b7-a1bc-7c0f0206dcdf", "list_date": "2019/04/21", "published_data": "2019", "summary": "\"This is a Borzoi Book\"--Copyright page."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "006265506X", "primary_isbn13": "9780062655066", "publisher": "Harper", "description": "The development of NASA and the space race against the Soviet Union during the Cold War.", "price": "0.00", "title": "American Moonshot", "author": "Douglas Brinkley", "contributor": "by Douglas Brinkley", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780062655066.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 493, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/American-Moonshot-Kennedy-Great-Space/dp/006265506X?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "006265506X", "isbn13": "9780062655066"}, {"isbn10": "0062655086", "isbn13": "9780062655080"}, {"isbn10": "0062859919", "isbn13": "9780062859914"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/American-Moonshot-Kennedy-Great-Space/dp/006265506X?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780062655066?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780062655066"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FAMERICAN%2BMOONSHOT%2FDouglas%2BBrinkley%2F9780062655066"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780062655066"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062655066?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/e9852342-63ec-561a-9dd1-3b94cec91d75", "list_date": "2019/04/21", "published_data": "2019-04-02", "summary": "As the fiftieth anniversary of the first lunar landing approaches, the award winning historian and perennial New York Times bestselling author takes a fresh look at the space program, President John F. Kennedy\u2019s inspiring challenge, and America\u2019s race to the moon. \u201cWe choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win.\u201d\u2014President John F. Kennedy On May 25, 1961, JFK made an astonishing announcement: his goal of putting a man on the moon by the end of the decade. In this engrossing, fast-paced epic, Douglas Brinkley returns to the 1960s to recreate one of the most exciting and ambitious achievements in the history of humankind. American Moonshot brings together the extraordinary political, cultural, and scientific factors that fueled the birth and development of NASA and the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo projects, which shot the United States to victory in the space race against the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War. Drawing on new primary source material and major interviews with many of the surviving figures who were key to America\u2019s success, Brinkley brings this fascinating history to life as never before. American Moonshot is a portrait of the brilliant men and women who made this giant leap possible, the technology that enabled us to propel men beyond earth\u2019s orbit to the moon and return them safely, and the geopolitical tensions that spurred Kennedy to commit himself fully to this audacious dream. Brinkley\u2019s ensemble cast of New Frontier characters include rocketeer Wernher von Braun, astronaut John Glenn and space booster Lyndon Johnson. A vivid and enthralling chronicle of one of the most thrilling, hopeful, and turbulent eras in the nation\u2019s history, American Moonshot is an homage to scientific ingenuity, human curiosity, and the boundless American spirit."}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "None", "primary_isbn13": "9780062209818", "publisher": "Dey St.", "description": "The story of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce as told by the four original members of the band.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Dirt", "author": "Tommy Lee, Vince Neil, Mick Mars, Nikki Sixx and Neil Strauss", "contributor": "by Tommy Lee, Vince Neil, Mick Mars, Nikki Sixx and Neil Strauss", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780060989156.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 491, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Dirt-Confessions-Worlds-Most-Notorious/dp/0060989157?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0060989157", "isbn13": "9780060989156"}, {"isbn10": "0062012339", "isbn13": "9780062012333"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Dirt-Confessions-Worlds-Most-Notorious/dp/0060989157?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780062209818?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780062209818"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BDIRT%2FTommy%2BLee%252C%2BVince%2BNeil%252C%2BMick%2BMars%252C%2BNikki%2BSixx%2Band%2BNeil%2BStrauss%2F9780062209818"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780062209818"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062209818?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/50d24063-a6d8-5cac-aeea-c8c32fc0827e", "list_date": "2019/04/14"}, {"rank": 11, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0316230030", "primary_isbn13": "9780316230032", "publisher": "Little, Brown Spark", "description": "The physician and sociologist makes his case that genes affect the ways we make societies and natural selection guides us toward creating a good society.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Blueprint", "author": "Nicholas A Christakis", "contributor": "by Nicholas A.

For too long, scientists have focused on the dark side of our biological heritage: our capacity for aggression, cruelty, prejudice, and self-interest. But natural selection has given us a suite of beneficial social features, including our capacity for love, friendship, cooperation, and learning. Beneath all our inventions -- our tools, farms, machines, cities, nations -- we carry with us innate proclivities to make a good society. In Blueprint, Nicholas A. Christakis introduces the compelling idea that our genes affect not only our bodies and behaviors, but also the ways in which we make societies, ones that are surprisingly similar worldwide. With many vivid examples -- including diverse historical and contemporary cultures, communities formed in the wake of shipwrecks, commune dwellers seeking utopia, online groups thrown together by design or involving artificially intelligent bots, and even the tender and complex social arrangements of elephants and dolphins that so resemble our own -- Christakis shows that, despite a human history replete with violence, we cannot escape our social blueprint for goodness. In a world of increasing political and economic polarization, it's tempting to ignore the positive role of our evolutionary past. But by exploring the ancient roots of goodness in civilization, Blueprint shows that our genes have shaped societies for our welfare and that, in a feedback loop stretching back many thousands of years, societies have shaped, and are still shaping, our genes today."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1250214807", "primary_isbn13": "9781250214805", "publisher": "Picador", "description": "A memoir by the former minority leader of the Georgia House of Representatives who ran to be the state\u2019s governor in 2018.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Lead From The Outside", "author": "Stacey Abrams", "contributor": "by Stacey Abrams", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781250214805.jpg", "book_image_width": 326, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Lead-Outside-Build-Future-Change/dp/1250214807?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1250214807", "isbn13": "9781250214805"}, {"isbn10": "1250191297", "isbn13": "9781250191298"}, {"isbn10": "1250191300", "isbn13": "9781250191304"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Lead-Outside-Build-Future-Change/dp/1250214807?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781250214805?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781250214805"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FLEAD%2BFROM%2BTHE%2BOUTSIDE%2FStacey%2BAbrams%2F9781250214805"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781250214805"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250214805?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/c084876e-306d-5967-b849-899bbce4ae96", "list_date": "2019/04/14", "published_data": "2019-03-26", "summary": "A personal and empowering blueprint\u2014from one of America\u2019s rising Democratic stars\u2014for outsiders who seek to become the ones in charge Leadership is hard.

From launching a company, to starting a day care center for homeless teen moms, to running a successful political campaign, finding what you want to fight for is as critical as knowing how to turn thought into action. Stacey uses her experience and hard-won insights to break down how ambition, fear, money, and failure function in leadership, while offering personal stories that illuminate practical strategies. Stacey includes exercises to help you hone your skills and realize your aspirations. She discusses candidly what she has learned over the course of her impressive career: that differences in race, gender, and class are surmountable. With direction and dedication, being in the minority actually provides unique and vital strength, which we can employ to rise to the top and make real change."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1328589358", "primary_isbn13": "9781328589354", "publisher": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", "description": "The 2018 season provides a backdrop to an inside look at the New York Yankees.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Inside The Empire", "author": "Bob Klapisch and Paul Solotaroff", "contributor": "by Bob Klapisch and Paul Solotaroff", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781328589354.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Inside-Empire-Power-Behind-Yankees/dp/1328589358?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1328589358", "isbn13": "9781328589354"}, {"isbn10": "1328589129", "isbn13": "9781328589125"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Inside-Empire-Power-Behind-Yankees/dp/1328589358?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781328589354?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781328589354"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FINSIDE%2BTHE%2BEMPIRE%2FBob%2BKlapisch%2Band%2BPaul%2BSolotaroff%2F9781328589354"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781328589354"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781328589354?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/21e6aed3-d074-59fc-977f-b9ffca527d9f", "list_date": "2019/04/14", "published_data": "2019", "summary": "Forthcoming from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt"}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 11, "weeks_on_list": 4, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0812994760", "primary_isbn13": "9780812994766", "publisher": "Random House", "description": "A 31-year-old French mother led an intelligence organization that worked against Hitler and the Gestapo.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Madame Fourcade'S Secret War", "author": "Lynne Olson", "contributor": "by Lynne Olson", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780812994766.jpg", "book_image_width": 326, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Madame-Fourcades-Secret-War-Frances/dp/0812994760?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/books/review/lynne-olson-madame-fourcades-secret-war.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0812994760", "isbn13": "9780812994766"}, {"isbn10": "0812994779", "isbn13": "9780812994773"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Madame-Fourcades-Secret-War-Frances/dp/0812994760?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780812994766?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780812994766"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FMADAME%2BFOURCADE%2527S%2BSECRET%2BWAR%2FLynne%2BOlson%2F9780812994766"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780812994766"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780812994766?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/8cc2443a-7b31-5b56-8515-a1c689b3d38d", "list_date": "2019/04/14", "published_data": "2019-03-05", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 The little-known true story of Marie-Madeleine Fourcade, the woman who headed the largest spy network in occupied France during World War II, from the bestselling author of Citizens of London and Last Hope Island \u201cBrava to Lynne Olson for a biography that should challenge any outdated assumptions about who deserves to be called a hero.\u201d\u2014The Washington Post NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR AND THE WASHINGTON POST In 1941 a thirty-one-year-old Frenchwoman, a young mother born to privilege and known for her beauty and glamour, became the leader of a vast intelligence organization\u2014the only woman to serve as a chef de r\u00e9sistance during the war. Strong-willed, independent, and a lifelong rebel against her country\u2019s conservative, patriarchal society, Marie-Madeleine Fourcade was temperamentally made for the job. Her group\u2019s name was Alliance, but the Gestapo dubbed it Noah\u2019s Ark because its agents used the names of animals as their aliases. The name Marie-Madeleine chose for herself was Hedgehog: a tough little animal, unthreatening in appearance, that, as a colleague of hers put it, \u201ceven a lion would hesitate to bite.\u201d No other French spy network lasted as long or supplied as much crucial intelligence\u2014including providing American and British military commanders with a 55-foot-long map of the beaches and roads on which the Allies would land on D-Day\u2014as Alliance. The Gestapo pursued them relentlessly, capturing, torturing, and executing hundreds of its three thousand agents, including Fourcade\u2019s own lover and many of her key spies. Although Fourcade, the mother of two young children, moved her headquarters every few weeks, constantly changing her hair color, clothing, and identity, she was captured twice by the Nazis. Both times she managed to escape\u2014once by slipping naked through the bars of her jail cell\u2014and continued to hold her network together even as it repeatedly threatened to crumble around her. Now, in this dramatic account of the war that split France in two and forced its people to live side by side with their hated German occupiers, Lynne Olson tells the fascinating story of a woman who stood up for her nation, her fellow citizens, and herself. \u201cFast-paced and impressively researched . . . Olson writes with verve and a historian\u2019s authority. . . . With this gripping tale, Lynne Olson pays [Marie-Madeleine Fourcade] what history has so far denied her. France, slow to confront the stain of Vichy, would do well to finally honor a fighter most of us would want in our foxhole.\u201d\u2014The New York Times Book Review"}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0307576019", "primary_isbn13": "9780307576019", "publisher": "Bantam/Dell", "description": "Grisham's first nonfiction book concerns a man wrongly sentenced to death.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Innocent Man", "author": "John Grisham", "contributor": "by John Grisham", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780440243830.jpg", "book_image_width": 301, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "http://www.amazon.com/The-Innocent-Man-Grisham-John/dp/B007CHTQM2?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/09/books/09masl.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/books/review/Lewine.t.html", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0345532015", "isbn13": "9780345532015"}, {"isbn10": "0385340915", "isbn13": "9780385340915"}, {"isbn10": "0307576019", "isbn13": "9780307576019"}, {"isbn10": "0385517238", "isbn13": "9780385517232"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "http://www.amazon.com/The-Innocent-Man-Grisham-John/dp/B007CHTQM2?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780307576019?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780307576019"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BINNOCENT%2BMAN%2FJohn%2BGrisham%2F9780307576019"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780307576019"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780307576019?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/bf6a7547-6f04-5aa1-9563-2052d7dc78e3", "list_date": "2019/04/14", "published_data": "2010-03-16", "summary": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 John Grisham\u2019s first work of nonfiction: a true crime story that will terrify anyone who believes in the presumption of innocence. \u2022 LOOK FOR THE NETFLIX ORIGINAL DOCUMENTARY SERIES \u201cBoth an American tragedy and [Grisham\u2019s] strongest legal thriller yet, all the more gripping because it happens to be true.\u201d\u2014Entertainment Weekly In the town of Ada, Oklahoma, Ron Williamson was going to be the next Mickey Mantle.

Their swift, gilded rise to extraordinary power in Donald Trump\u2019s White House is unprecedented and dangerous.

They are entitled inheritors of the worst kind; their combination of ignorance, arrogance, and an insatiable lust for power has caused havoc all over the world, and may threaten the democracy of the United States. Ward follows their trajectory from New Jersey and New York City to the White House, where the couple\u2019s many forays into policy-making and national security have mocked long-standing U.S. policy and protocol. They have pursued a personal agenda that could increase their wealth while their actions have mostly gone unchecked. In Kushner, Inc., Ward holds Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump accountable: she unveils the couple\u2019s self-serving transactional motivations and how those have propelled them into the highest levels of the US government where no one, the President included, has been able to stop them."}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 5, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0393635066", "primary_isbn13": "9780393635065", "publisher": "Norton", "description": "The death of a chimpanzee matriarch frames a broader look into the world of animal and human emotions.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Mama'S Last Hug", "author": "Frans de Waal", "contributor": "by Frans de Waal", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780393635065.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Mamas-Last-Hug-Emotions-Ourselves/dp/0393635066?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0393635066", "isbn13": "9780393635065"}, {"isbn10": "0393635074", "isbn13": "9780393635072"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Mamas-Last-Hug-Emotions-Ourselves/dp/0393635066?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780393635065?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780393635065"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FMAMA%2527S%2BLAST%2BHUG%2FFrans%2Bde%2BWaal%2F9780393635065"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780393635065"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780393635065?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/00710e23-d255-5f9b-9028-33dccd5bce0f", "list_date": "2019/04/07", "published_data": "2019-03-12", "summary": "A New York Times Bestseller and winner of the PEN / E. O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award Primatologist Frans de Waal explores the fascinating world of animal and human emotions. Frans de Waal has spent four decades at the forefront of animal research. Following up on the best-selling Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?, which investigated animal intelligence, Mama\u2019s Last Hug delivers a fascinating exploration of the rich emotional lives of animals. Mama\u2019s Last Hug begins with the death of Mama, a chimpanzee matriarch who formed a deep bond with biologist Jan van Hooff. When Mama was dying, van Hooff took the unusual step of visiting her in her night cage for a last hug. Their goodbyes were filmed and went viral. Millions of people were deeply moved by the way Mama embraced the professor, welcoming him with a big smile while reassuring him by patting his neck, in a gesture often considered typically human but that is in fact common to all primates. This story and others like it form the core of de Waal\u2019s argument, showing that humans are not the only species with the capacity for love, hate, fear, shame, guilt, joy, disgust, and empathy. De Waal discusses facial expressions, the emotions behind human politics, the illusion of free will, animal sentience, and, of course, Mama\u2019s life and death. The message is one of continuity between us and other species, such as the radical proposal that emotions are like organs: we don\u2019t have a single organ that other animals don\u2019t have, and the same is true for our emotions. Mama\u2019s Last Hug opens our hearts and minds to the many ways in which humans and other animals are connected, transforming how we view the living world around us."}, {"rank": 12, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0399589287", "primary_isbn13": "9780399589287", "publisher": "Random House", "description": "A biography of the first female Supreme Court justice.", "price": "0.00", "title": "First: Sandra Day O'Connor", "author": "Evan Thomas", "contributor": "by Evan Thomas", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780399589287.jpg", "book_image_width": 326, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/First-Sandra-OConnor-Evan-Thomas/dp/0399589287?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/books/review/evan-thomas-first-sandra-day-oconnor.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0399589287", "isbn13": "9780399589287"}, {"isbn10": "0399589295", "isbn13": "9780399589294"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/First-Sandra-OConnor-Evan-Thomas/dp/0399589287?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780399589287?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780399589287"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FFIRST%253A%2BSANDRA%2BDAY%2BO%2527CONNOR%2FEvan%2BThomas%2F9780399589287"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780399589287"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780399589287?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/92363a91-ada0-5430-8d50-2bc0744505e1", "list_date": "2019/04/07", "published_data": "2019-03-19", "summary": "\"Based on exclusive interviews and access to the Supreme Court archives, this is the intimate, inspiring, and authoritative biography of America's first female Justice, Sandra Day O'Connor--by New York Times bestselling author Evan Thomas. She was born in 1930 in El Paso and grew up on a cattle ranch in Arizona. At a time when women were expected to be homemakers, she set her sights on Stanford University. When she graduated near the top of her class at law school in 1952, no firm would even interview her. But Sandra Day O'Connor's story is that of a woman who repeatedly shattered glass ceilings--doing so with a blend of grace, wisdom, humor, understatement, and cowgirl toughness. She became the first-ever female majority leader of a state senate. As a judge on the Arizona State Court of Appeals, she stood up to corrupt lawyers and humanized the law. When she arrived at the Supreme Court, appointed by Reagan in 1981, she began a quarter-century tenure on the court, hearing cases that ultimately shaped American law. Diagnosed with cancer at fifty-eight, and caring for a husband with Alzheimer's, O'Connor endured every difficulty with grit and poise. Women and men today will be inspired by how to be first in your own life, how to know when to fight and when to walk away, through O'Connor's example. This is a remarkably vivid and personal portrait of a woman who loved her family and believed in serving her country, who, when she became the most powerful woman in America, built a bridge forward for the women who followed her\"--"}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 6, "weeks_on_list": 5, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0525576703", "primary_isbn13": "9780525576709", "publisher": "Tim Duggan", "description": "How climate-related crises may cause food shortages, refugee emergencies and other catastrophes.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Uninhabitable Earth", "author": "David Wallace-Wells", "contributor": "by David Wallace-Wells", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780525576709.jpg", "book_image_width": 293, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Uninhabitable-Earth-Life-After-Warming/dp/0525576703?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/books/review-uninhabitable-earth-life-after-warming-david-wallace-wells.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0525576703", "isbn13": "9780525576709"}, {"isbn10": "052557672X", "isbn13": "9780525576723"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Uninhabitable-Earth-Life-After-Warming/dp/0525576703?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780525576709?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780525576709"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BUNINHABITABLE%2BEARTH%2FDavid%2BWallace-Wells%2F9780525576709"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780525576709"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780525576709?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/cbf280ca-06e7-5d5d-b247-6aa15fc84bc1", "list_date": "2019/04/07", "published_data": "2019", "summary": "\"The Uninhabitable Earth hits you like a comet, with an overflow of insanely lyrical prose about our pending Armageddon.\"--Andrew Solomon, author of The Noonday Demon It is worse, much worse, than you think. If your anxiety about global warming is dominated by fears of sea-level rise, you are barely scratching the surface of what terrors are possible. In California, wildfires now rage year-round, destroying thousands of homes. Across the US, \"500-year\" storms pummel communities month after month, and floods displace tens of millions annually. This is only a preview of the changes to come. And they are coming fast. Without a revolution in how billions of humans conduct their lives, parts of the Earth could become close to uninhabitable, and other parts horrifically inhospitable, as soon as the end of this century. In his travelogue of our near future, David Wallace-Wells brings into stark relief the climate troubles that await--food shortages, refugee emergencies, and other crises that will reshape the globe. But the world will be remade by warming in more profound ways as well, transforming our politics, our culture, our relationship to technology, and our sense of history. It will be all-encompassing, shaping and distorting nearly every aspect of human life as it is lived today. Like An Inconvenient Truth and Silent Spring before it, The Uninhabitable Earth is both a meditation on the devastation we have brought upon ourselves and an impassioned call to action. For just as the world was brought to the brink of catastrophe within the span of a lifetime, the responsibility to avoid it now belongs to a single generation."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 9, "weeks_on_list": 5, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1250207576", "primary_isbn13": "9781250207579", "publisher": "St. Martin's", "description": "The former deputy director of the F.B.I. describes major events of his career and the ways the agency works to protect Americans.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Threat", "author": "Andrew G McCabe", "contributor": "by Andrew G.

McCabe was fired from his position as deputy director of the FBI. President Donald Trump celebrated on Twitter: \"Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy.\" In The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump, Andrew G. McCabe offers a dramatic and candid account of his career, and an impassioned defense of the FBI's agents, and of the institution's integrity and independence in protecting America and upholding our Constitution. McCabe started as a street agent in the FBI's New York field office, serving under director Louis Freeh. He became an expert in two kinds of investigations that are critical to American national security: Russian organized crime\u2014which is inextricably linked to the Russian state\u2014and terrorism. Under Director Robert Mueller, McCabe led the investigations of major attacks on American soil, including the Boston Marathon bombing, a plot to bomb the New York subways, and several narrowly averted bombings of aircraft. And under James Comey, McCabe was deeply involved in the controversial investigations of the Benghazi attack, the Clinton Foundation's activities, and Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. The Threat recounts in compelling detail the time between Donald Trump's November 2016 election and McCabe's firing, set against a page-turning narrative spanning two decades when the FBI's mission shifted to a new goal: preventing terrorist attacks on Americans. But as McCabe shows, right now the greatest threat to the United States comes from within, as President Trump and his administration ignore the law, attack democratic institutions, degrade human rights, and undermine the U.S. Constitution that protects every citizen. Important, revealing, and powerfully argued, The Threat tells the true story of what the FBI is, how it works, and why it will endure as an institution of integrity that protects America."}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 2, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1541673549", "primary_isbn13": "9781541673540", "publisher": "Basic", "description": "A defense stating that the current president adopted several traditional conservative positions.", "price": "0.00", "title": "The Case For Trump", "author": "Victor Davis Hanson", "contributor": "by Victor Davis Hanson", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781541673540.jpg", "book_image_width": 319, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Case-Trump-Victor-Davis-Hanson/dp/1541673549?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/books/review/victor-davis-hanson-case-for-trump.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1541673549", "isbn13": "9781541673540"}, {"isbn10": "1541673530", "isbn13": "9781541673533"}, {"isbn10": "1549174231", "isbn13": "9781549174230"}, {"isbn10": "154914877X", "isbn13": "9781549148774"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Case-Trump-Victor-Davis-Hanson/dp/1541673549?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781541673540?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781541673540"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHE%2BCASE%2BFOR%2BTRUMP%2FVictor%2BDavis%2BHanson%2F9781541673540"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781541673540"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781541673540?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/e9cf4e1c-4f67-51f9-9593-21c455b0149a", "list_date": "2019/03/31", "published_data": "2019-03-05", "summary": "This New York Times bestselling Trump biography from a major American intellectual explains how a renegade businessman became one of the most successful -- and necessary -- presidents of all time.

Trump alone saw a political opportunity in defending the working people of America's interior whom the coastal elite of both parties had come to scorn, Hanson argues. And Trump alone had the instincts and energy to pursue this opening to victory, dismantle a corrupt old order, and bring long-overdue policy changes at home and abroad. We could not survive a series of presidencies as volatile as Trump's.

When Clarence Smoyer is assigned to the gunner\u2019s seat of his Sherman tank, his crewmates discover that the gentle giant from Pennsylvania has a hidden talent: He\u2019s a natural-born shooter.

Their struggles help them grow into the authentic, empathetic, and wise people they have always wanted to be. In Women Rowing North, Pipher offers a timely examination of the cultural and developmental issues women face as they age. Drawing on her own experience as daughter, sister, mother, grandmother, caregiver, clinical psychologist, and cultural anthropologist, she explores ways women can cultivate resilient responses to the challenges they face. \"If we can keep our wits about us, think clearly, and manage our emotions skillfully,\" Pipher writes, \"we will experience a joyous time of our lives.

Yet Rohr has never written on the most perennially talked about topic in Christianity: Jesus. Most know who Jesus was, but who was Christ? Is the word simply Jesus\u2019s last name? Too often, Rohr writes, our understandings have been limited by culture, religious debate, and the human tendency to put ourselves at the center. Drawing on scripture, history, and spiritual practice, Rohr articulates a transformative view of Jesus Christ as a portrait of God\u2019s constant, unfolding work in the world. \u201cGod loves things by becoming them,\u201d he writes, and Jesus\u2019s life was meant to declare that humanity has never been separate from God\u2014except by its own negative choice. When we recover this fundamental truth, faith becomes less about proving Jesus was God, and more about learning to recognize the Creator\u2019s presence all around us, and in everyone we meet.

But when he impulsively auditioned for a school production of West Side Story, he found his purpose--or so it seemed. Within a few years Gary and a handful of friends created what became one of the most exciting and important new theater companies in America. From its humble beginnings in a suburban Chicago church basement and eventual move into the city, the Steppenwolf Theatre Company launched a series of groundbreaking productions, igniting Gary's career along with those of John Malkovich, Joan Allen, Gary Cole, Laurie Metcalf, Jeff Perry, John Mahoney, and others. Television and film came calling soon after, and Gary starred in Of Mice and Men (which he also directed) and The Stand before taking the role that would change his life in unforeseeable ways: Lieutenant Dan in the Academy Award-winning Forrest Gump. The military community's embrace of the character of the disabled veteran was matched only by the depth of Gary's realization that America's defenders had not received all the honor, respect, and gratitude their sacrifices deserve. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, this became Gary's mission. While starring in hits like Apollo 13, Ransom, Truman, George Wallace, CSI: NY, and Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders, Gary has worked tirelessly on behalf of those who serve this country, entertaining more than a half million troops around the world playing bass guitar with his Lt. Dan Band, raising funds on behalf of veterans, and eventually founding the Gary Sinise Foundation with a mission to serve and honor America's defenders, veterans, first responders, their families, and those in need. Grateful American is the moving, entertaining, profoundly gripping story of how one man found his calling: to see that those who defend this country and its freedoms are never forgotten."}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 4, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0547347928", "primary_isbn13": "9780547347929", "publisher": "Mariner", "description": "A father struggles with his son's meth addiction.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Beautiful Boy", "author": "David Sheff", "contributor": "by David Sheff", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780618683352.jpg", "book_image_width": 324, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Boy-Fathers-Journey-Addiction/dp/0547203888?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/21/books/21masl.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/books/review/Morrice-t.html", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0547347928", "isbn13": "9780547347929"}, {"isbn10": "1328974715", "isbn13": "9781328974716"}, {"isbn10": "0547203888", "isbn13": "9780547203881"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Boy-Fathers-Journey-Addiction/dp/0547203888?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780547347929?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780547347929"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FBEAUTIFUL%2BBOY%2FDavid%2BSheff%2F9780547347929"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780547347929"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780547347929?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/8b68f9f9-25ee-5c53-9cec-ce63117a1709", "list_date": "2019/03/17", "published_data": "2009-01-06", "summary": "#1 New York Times bestseller With a new afterword Now a Major Motion Picture Starring Steve Carell * Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet * Maura Tierney * and Amy Ryan \u201cA brilliant, harrowing, heartbreaking, fascinating story, full of beautiful moments and hard-won wisdom.

In 1776, an elite group of soldiers were handpicked to serve as George Washington\u2019s bodyguards. Washington trusted them; relied on them. But unbeknownst to Washington, some of them were part of a treasonous plan. In the months leading up to the Revolutionary War, these traitorous soldiers, along with the Governor of New York, William Tryon, and Mayor David Mathews, launched a deadly plot against the most important member of the military: George Washington himself. This is the story of the secret plot and how it was revealed. It is a story of leaders, liars, counterfeiters, and jailhouse confessors. It also shows just how hard the battle was for George Washington and how close America was to losing the Revolutionary War. In this historical page-turner, New York Times bestselling author Brad Meltzer teams up with American history writer and documentary television producer, Josh Mensch to unravel the shocking true story behind what has previously been a footnote in the pages of history. Drawing on extensive research, Meltzer and Mensch capture in riveting detail how George Washington not only defeated the most powerful military force in the world, but also uncovered the secret plot against him in the tumultuous days leading up to July 4, 1776.

With more than one in every five people over the age of fourteen addicted, drug abuse has been called the most formidable health problem worldwide. If we are not victims ourselves, we all know someone struggling with the merciless compulsion to alter their experience by changing how their brain functions. Drawing on years of research--as well as personal experience as a recovered addict--researcher and professor Judy Grisel has reached a fundamental conclusion: for the addict, there will never be enough drugs. The brain's capacity to learn and adapt is seemingly infinite, allowing it to counteract any regular disruption, including that caused by drugs. What begins as a normal state punctuated by periods of being high transforms over time into a state of desperate craving that is only temporarily subdued by a fix, explaining why addicts are unable to live either with or without their drug. One by one, Grisel shows how different drugs act on the brain, the kind of experiential effects they generate, and the specific reasons why each is so hard to kick. Grisel's insights lead to a better understanding of the brain's critical contributions to addictive behavior, and will help inform a more rational, coherent, and compassionate response to the epidemic in our homes and communities\"--"}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1472966155", "primary_isbn13": "9781472966155", "publisher": "Bloomsbury Continuum", "description": "The cover-up of sexual abuse, the clerical culture of secrecy and the double lives of priests in the Roman Catholic Church.", "price": "0.00", "title": "In The Closet Of The Vatican", "author": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martel", "contributor": "by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martel", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781472966155.jpg", "book_image_width": 324, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Closet-Vatican-Power-Homosexuality-Hypocrisy-ebook/dp/B07NJ9DQSK?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1472966155", "isbn13": "9781472966155"}, {"isbn10": "1472966147", "isbn13": "9781472966148"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Closet-Vatican-Power-Homosexuality-Hypocrisy-ebook/dp/B07NJ9DQSK?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781472966155?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781472966155"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FIN%2BTHE%2BCLOSET%2BOF%2BTHE%2BVATICAN%2FFr%25C3%25A9d%25C3%25A9ric%2BMartel%2F9781472966155"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781472966155"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781472966155?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/a2b73aba-9513-57c4-b2b5-a28b9d8dc0bb", "list_date": "2019/03/10", "published_data": "2019-02-21", "summary": "The New York Times Bestseller '[An] earth-shaking expos\u00e9 of clerical corruption' - National Catholic Reporter In the Closet of the Vatican exposes the rot at the heart of the Vatican and the Roman Catholic Church today. This brilliant piece of investigative writing is based on four years' authoritative research, including extensive interviews with those in power. The celibacy of priests, the condemnation of the use of contraceptives, the cover up of countless cases of sexual abuse, the resignation of Benedict XVI, misogyny among the clergy, the dramatic fall in Europe of the number of vocations to the priesthood, the plotting against Pope Francis \u2013 all these issues are clouded in mystery and secrecy. In the Closet of the Vatican is a book that reveals these secrets and penetrates this enigma. It derives from a system founded on a clerical culture of secrecy which starts in junior seminaries and continues right up to the Vatican itself. It is based on the double lives of priests and on extreme homophobia. The resulting schizophrenia in the Church is hard to fathom. But the more a prelate is homophobic, the more likely it is that he is himself gay. 'Behind rigidity there is always something hidden, in many cases a double life'. These are the words of Pope Francis himself and with them the Pope has unlocked the Closet. No one can claim to really understand the Catholic Church today until they have read this book. It reveals a truth that is extraordinary and disturbing."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 13, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0316421790", "primary_isbn13": "9780316421799", "publisher": "Hachette", "description": "The former governor of New Jersey describes his relationship with President Trump and the tensions among others close to the president.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Let Me Finish", "author": "Chris Christie with Ellis Henican", "contributor": "by Chris Christie with Ellis Henican", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780316421799.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Let-Me-Finish-Kushners-Your-Face/dp/0316421790?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0316421790", "isbn13": "9780316421799"}, {"isbn10": "0316421804", "isbn13": "9780316421805"}, {"isbn10": "0316454125", "isbn13": "9780316454124"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Let-Me-Finish-Kushners-Your-Face/dp/0316421790?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780316421799?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780316421799"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FLET%2BME%2BFINISH%2FChris%2BChristie%2Bwith%2BEllis%2BHenican%2F9780316421799"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780316421799"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780316421799?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/b2ea70ae-d5bf-51e4-9880-db24a5f8b2cb", "list_date": "2019/03/03", "published_data": "2019-01-29", "summary": "The instant New York Times-bestselling memoir from the outspoken former governor--an \"explosive\" (Guardian) \"must read\" (Hugh Hewitt) account of Chris Christie's life in politics including his \"not to miss\" (Entertainment Weekly) insights into Donald Trump. After dropping out of the 2016 presidential race, Chris Christie stunned the political world by becoming the first major official to endorse Donald Trump. A friend of Trump's for fifteen years, the two-term New Jersey governor understood the future president as well as anyone in the political arena--and Christie quickly became one of Trump's most trusted advisers. Tapped with running Trump's transition team, Christie was nearly named his running mate. But within days of Trump's surprise victory over Hillary Clinton, Christie was in for his own surprise: he was being booted out. In Let Me Finish, Christie sets the record straight about his tenure as a corruption-fighting prosecutor and a Republican running a Democratic state, as well as what really happened on the 2016 campaign trail and inside Trump Tower. Christie takes readers inside the ego-driven battles for Trump's attention among figures like Steve Bannon, Corey Lewandowksi, Reince Priebus, Kellyanne Conway, Jeff Sessions, and Paul Manafort. He shows how the literal trashing of Christie's transition plan put the new administration in the hands of self-serving amateurs, all but guaranteeing the Trump presidency's shaky start. Christie also addresses hot-button issues from his own years in power, including what really went down during Bridgegate. And, for the first time, Christie tells the full story of the Kushner saga: how, as a federal prosecutor, Christie put Jared Kushner's powerful father behind bars--a fact Trump's son-in-law makes Christie pay for later. Packed with news-making revelations and told with the kind of bluntness few politicians can match, Christie's memoir is an essential guide to understanding the Trump presidency."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 10, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1400201756", "primary_isbn13": "9781400201754", "publisher": "Thomas Nelson", "description": "A woman rebuilds her life after she learns her father is the infamous killer known as BTK.", "price": "0.00", "title": "A Serial Killer'S Daughter", "author": "Kerri Rawson", "contributor": "by Kerri Rawson", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781400201761.jpg", "book_image_width": 325, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Serial-Killers-Daughter-Story-Overcoming-ebook/dp/B07BB69VNY?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1400201764", "isbn13": "9781400201761"}, {"isbn10": "1400201756", "isbn13": "9781400201754"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Serial-Killers-Daughter-Story-Overcoming-ebook/dp/B07BB69VNY?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781400201754?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781400201754"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FA%2BSERIAL%2BKILLER%2527S%2BDAUGHTER%2FKerri%2BRawson%2F9781400201754"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781400201754"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781400201754?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/2d2ca283-08d3-55d4-a06e-d88742ddb01c", "list_date": "2019/03/03", "published_data": "2019", "summary": "Now a New York Times Bestseller What is it like to learn that your ordinary, loving father is a serial killer? In 2005, Kerri Rawson heard a knock on the door of her apartment. When she opened it, an FBI agent informed her that her father had been arrested for murdering ten people, including two children. It was then that she learned her father was the notorious serial killer known as BTK, a name he'd given himself that described the horrific way he committed his crimes: bind, torture, kill. As news of his capture spread, Wichitacelebrated the end of a thirty-one-year nightmare. For Kerri Rawson, another was just beginning. She was plunged into a black hole of horror and disbelief. The same man who had been a loving father, a devoted husband, church president, Boy Scout leader, and a public servant had been using their family as a cover for his heinous crimes since before she was born. Everything she had believed about her life had been a lie. Written with candor and extraordinary courage, A Serial Killer's Daughter is an unflinching exploration of life with one of America's most infamous killers and an astonishing tale of personal and spiritual transformation. For all who suffer from unhealed wounds or the crippling effects of violence, betrayal, and anger, Kerri Rawson's story offers the hope of reclaiming sanity in the midst of madness, rebuilding a life in the shadow of death, and learning to forgive the unforgivable. \"No easy answers here.

Stretching between these figures is a cast of artists, writers, and scientists--mostly women, mostly queer--whose public contribution have risen out of their unclassifiable and often heartbreaking private relationships to change the way we understand, experience, and appreciate the universe. Among them are the astronomer Maria Mitchell, who paved the way for women in science; the sculptor Harriet Hosmer, who did the same in art; the journalist and literary critic Margaret Fuller, who sparked the feminist movement; and the poet Emily Dickinson. Emanating from these lives are larger questions about the measure of a good life and what it means to leave a lasting mark of betterment on an imperfect world: Are achievement and acclaim enough for happiness? Is genius? Is love? Weaving through the narrative is a set of peripheral figures--Ralph Waldo Emerson, Charles Darwin, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Herman Melville, Frederick Douglass, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Walt Whitman--and a tapestry of themes spanning music, feminism, the history of science, the rise and decline of religion, and how the intersection of astronomy, poetry, and Transcendentalist philosophy fomented the environmental movement."}, {"rank": 9, "rank_last_week": 4, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0525509445", "primary_isbn13": "9780525509448", "publisher":

author of Searching for Sunday and Inspired Negative messages about sex come from all corners of society: from the church, from the media, from our own families. As a result, countless people have suffered pain, guilt, and judgment. In this instant bestseller, Nadia Bolz-Weber unleashes her critical eye and her vulnerable yet hopeful soul on the harmful conversations about sex that have fed our shame. Bolz-Weber offers no simple amendments or polite compromises. Instead, this modern-day reverend calls for an inclusivity that empowers us to be loyal to people and, perhaps most important, ourselves. \u201cChristianity is not a program for avoiding mistakes,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt is a faith of the guilty.\u201d With an alternative understanding of Scripture passages that have been weaponized against Christians for decades, Bolz-Weber reminds us that sexual flourishing can and should be for all genders, all bodies, and all humans. She shares stories, poetry, and Scripture that wage war on perpetual anxiety around sex by celebrating sexuality in all its forms and recognizing it for the gift that it is. If you\u2019ve been mistreated, confused, angered, and/or wounded by shaming sexual messages, this one is for you."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 6, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0062802208", "primary_isbn13": "9780062802200", "publisher": "Harper", "description": "The former secretary of state examines the legacy of fascism in the 20th century and its potential revival.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Fascism: A Warning", "author": "Madeleine Albright with Bill Woodward", "contributor": "by Madeleine Albright with Bill Woodward", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780062802187.jpg", "book_image_width": 325, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Fascism-Warning-Madeleine-Albright/dp/0062802186?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/books/review/fascism-a-warning-madeleine-albright.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0062802186", "isbn13": "9780062802187"}, {"isbn10": "0062802232", "isbn13": "9780062802231"}, {"isbn10": "0062802240", "isbn13": "9780062802248"}, {"isbn10": "1538544512", "isbn13": "9781538544518"}, {"isbn10": "1538544504", "isbn13": "9781538544501"}, {"isbn10": "1538544520", "isbn13": "9781538544525"}, {"isbn10": "0062802208", "isbn13": "9780062802200"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Fascism-Warning-Madeleine-Albright/dp/0062802186?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780062802200?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780062802200"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FFASCISM%253A%2BA%2BWarning%2FMadeleine%2BAlbright%2Bwith%2BBill%2BWoodward%2F9780062802200"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780062802200"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062802200?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/7d1ecd1e-a237-532f-93e2-5c84c713da25", "list_date": "2019/02/17", "published_data": "2019-01-29", "summary": "#1 New York Times Bestseller Best Books of 2018 --The Economist A personal and urgent examination of Fascism in the twentieth century and how its legacy shapes today\u2019s world, written by one of America\u2019s most admired public servants, the first woman to serve as U.S. secretary of state A Fascist, observes Madeleine Albright, \u201cis someone who claims to speak for a whole nation or group, is utterly unconcerned with the rights of others, and is willing to use violence and whatever other means are necessary to achieve the goals he or she might have.\u201d The twentieth century was defined by the clash between democracy and Fascism, a struggle that created uncertainty about the survival of human freedom and left millions dead. Given the horrors of that experience, one might expect the world to reject the spiritual successors to Hitler and Mussolini should they arise in our era. In Fascism: A Warning, Madeleine Albright draws on her experiences as a child in war-torn Europe and her distinguished career as a diplomat to question that assumption. Fascism, as she shows, not only endured through the twentieth century but now presents a more virulent threat to peace and justice than at any time since the end of World War II. The momentum toward democracy that swept the world when the Berlin Wall fell has gone into reverse. The United States, which historically championed the free world, is led by a president who exacerbates division and heaps scorn on democratic institutions. In many countries, economic, technological, and cultural factors are weakening the political center and empowering the extremes of right and left. Contemporary leaders such as Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un are employing many of the tactics used by Fascists in the 1920s and 30s. Fascism: A Warning is a book for our times that is relevant to all times. Written by someone who has not only studied history but helped to shape it, this call to arms teaches us the lessons we must understand and the questions we must answer if we are to save ourselves from repeating the tragic errors of the past."}, {"rank": 9, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 11, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1538763044", "primary_isbn13": "9781538763049", "publisher": "Grand Central", "description": "A memoir by the two-time Academy Award and three-time Emmy Award winner.", "price": "0.00", "title": "In Pieces", "author": "Sally Field", "contributor": "by Sally Field", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781538763025.jpg", "book_image_width": 327, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Pieces-Sally-Field/dp/1538763028?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1538763028", "isbn13": "9781538763025"}, {"isbn10": "1538714698", "isbn13": "9781538714690"}, {"isbn10": "1538763044", "isbn13": "9781538763049"}, {"isbn10": "1549143085", "isbn13": "9781549143083"}, {"isbn10": "1549143077", "isbn13": "9781549143076"}, {"isbn10": "1549145444", "isbn13": "9781549145445"}, {"isbn10": "1471175790", "isbn13": "9781471175794"}, {"isbn10": "1538763036", "isbn13": "9781538763032"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Pieces-Sally-Field/dp/1538763028?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781538763049?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781538763049"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FIN%2BPIECES%2FSally%2BField%2F9781538763049"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781538763049"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781538763049?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/14b4f8e0-da8c-5a32-9b63-55a34b275d72", "list_date": "2019/02/10", "published_data": "2018-09-18", "summary": "In this intimate, haunting literary memoir and New York Times Notable Book of the year, an American icon tells her own story for the first time -- about a challenging and lonely childhood, the craft that helped her find her voice, and a powerful emotional legacy that shaped her journey as a daughter and a mother. One of the most celebrated, beloved, and enduring actors of our time, Sally Field has an infectious charm that has captivated the nation for more than five decades, beginning with her first TV role at the age of seventeen. From Gidget's sweet-faced \"girl next door\" to the dazzling complexity of Sybil to the Academy Award-worthy ferocity and depth of Norma Rae and Mary Todd Lincoln, Field has stunned audiences time and time again with her artistic range and emotional acuity. Yet there is one character who always remained hidden: the shy and anxious little girl within. With raw honesty and the fresh, pitch-perfect prose of a natural-born writer, and with all the humility and authenticity her fans have come to expect, Field brings readers behind-the-scenes for not only the highs and lows of her star-studded early career in Hollywood, but deep into the truth of her lifelong relationships--including her complicated love for her own mother.

A brilliant feat of storytelling, monumental in scope, yet put together with tenderness for a man who had always believed that he would be Britain\u2019s savior.\u201d \u2014Wall Street Journal In this landmark biography of Winston Churchill based on extensive new material, the true genius of the man, statesman and leader can finally be fully seen and understood--by the bestselling, award-winning author of Napoleon and The Last King of America. When we seek an example of great leaders with unalloyed courage, the person who comes to mind is Winston Churchill: the iconic, visionary war leader immune from the consensus of the day, who stood firmly for his beliefs when everyone doubted him. But how did young Winston become Churchill? What gave him the strength to take on the superior force of Nazi Germany when bombs rained on London and so many others had caved? In Churchill, Andrew Roberts gives readers the full and definitive Winston Churchill, from birth to lasting legacy, as personally revealing as it is compulsively readable. Roberts gained exclusive access to extensive new material: transcripts of War Cabinet meetings, diaries, letters and unpublished memoirs from Churchill's contemporaries. The Royal Family permitted Roberts--in a first for a Churchill biographer--to read the detailed notes taken by King George VI in his diary after his weekly meetings with Churchill during World War II. This treasure trove of access allows Roberts to understand the man in revelatory new ways, and to identify the hidden forces fueling Churchill's legendary drive. We think of Churchill as a hero who saved civilization from the evils of Nazism and warned of the grave crimes of Soviet communism, but Roberts's masterwork reveals that he has as much to teach us about the challenges leaders face today--and the fundamental values of courage, tenacity, leadership and moral conviction."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 5, "weeks_on_list": 14, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "125012381X", "primary_isbn13": "9781250123817", "publisher": "Flatiron", "description": "A look at our biases and the argument for why the world is in a better state than we might think.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Factfulness", "author": "Hans Rosling with Ola Rosling and Anna Rosling Ronnlund", "contributor": "by Hans Rosling with Ola Rosling and Anna Rosling Ronnlund", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781250123817.jpg", "book_image_width": 322, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Factfulness-Reasons-World-Things-Better-ebook/dp/B0756J1LLV?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1250107814", "isbn13": "9781250107817"}, {"isbn10": "125012381X", "isbn13": "9781250123817"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Factfulness-Reasons-World-Things-Better-ebook/dp/B0756J1LLV?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781250123817?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781250123817"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FFACTFULNESS%2FHans%2BRosling%2Bwith%2BOla%2BRosling%2Band%2BAnna%2BRosling%2BRonnlund%2F9781250123817"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781250123817"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250123817?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/76cc4a7d-37c3-55f4-9971-fd87c5c47670", "list_date": "2019/02/10", "published_data": "2018-04-03", "summary": "INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u201cOne of the most important books I\u2019ve ever read\u2014an indispensable guide to thinking clearly about the world.\u201d \u2013 Bill Gates \u201cHans Rosling tells the story of \u2018the secret silent miracle of human progress\u2019 as only he can.

When asked simple questions about global trends\u2014what percentage of the world\u2019s population live in poverty; why the world\u2019s population is increasing; how many girls finish school\u2014we systematically get the answers wrong. So wrong that a chimpanzee choosing answers at random will consistently outguess teachers, journalists, Nobel laureates, and investment bankers. In Factfulness, Professor of International Health and global TED phenomenon Hans Rosling, together with his two long-time collaborators, Anna and Ola, offers a radical new explanation of why this happens. They reveal the ten instincts that distort our perspective\u2014from our tendency to divide the world into two camps (usually some version of us and them) to the way we consume media (where fear rules) to how we perceive progress (believing that most things are getting worse). Our problem is that we don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know, and even our guesses are informed by unconscious and predictable biases. It turns out that the world, for all its imperfections, is in a much better state than we might think. That doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t real concerns. But when we worry about everything all the time instead of embracing a worldview based on facts, we can lose our ability to focus on the things that threaten us most.

Yuval Noah Harari\u2019s 21 Lessons for the 21st Century is a probing and visionary investigation into today\u2019s most urgent issues as we move into the uncharted territory of the future. As technology advances faster than our understanding of it, hacking becomes a tactic of war, and the world feels more polarized than ever, Harari addresses the challenge of navigating life in the face of constant and disorienting change and raises the important questions we need to ask ourselves in order to survive. In twenty-one accessible chapters that are both provocative and profound, Harari builds on the ideas explored in his previous books, untangling political, technological, social, and existential issues and offering advice on how to prepare for a very different future from the world we now live in: How can we retain freedom of choice when Big Data is watching us? What will the future workforce look like, and how should we ready ourselves for it? How should we deal with the threat of terrorism? Why is liberal democracy in crisis?

But upon discovering how these remarkable substances are improving the lives not only of the mentally ill but also of healthy people coming to grips with the challenges of everyday life, he decided to explore the landscape of the mind in the first person as well as the third. Thus began a singular adventure into various altered states of consciousness, along with a dive deep into both the latest brain science and the thriving underground community of psychedelic therapists. Pollan sifts the historical record to separate the truth about these mysterious drugs from the myths that have surrounded them since the 1960s, when a handful of psychedelic evangelists inadvertently catalyzed a powerful backlash against what was then a promising field of research. A unique and elegant blend of science, memoir, travel writing, history, and medicine, How to Change Your Mind is a triumph of participatory journalism. By turns dazzling and edifying, it is the gripping account of a journey to an exciting and unexpected new frontier in our understanding of the mind, the self, and our place in the world. The true subject of Pollan's \"mental travelogue\" is not just psychedelic drugs but also the eternal puzzle of human consciousness and how, in a world that offers us both suffering and joy, we can do our best to be fully present and find meaning in our lives."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 5, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "", "primary_isbn13":

A few were swiftly caught, including the notorious SS leader, Heinrich Himmler. Others, however, evaded capture through a sophisticated Nazi organization designed to hide them. Among those war criminals were Josef Mengele, the \u201cAngel of Death\u201d who performed hideous medical experiments at Auschwitz; Martin Bormann, Hitler\u2019s brutal personal secretary; Klaus Barbie, the cruel \"Butcher of Lyon\"; and perhaps the most awful Nazi of all: Adolf Eichmann. Killing the SS is the epic saga of the espionage and daring waged by self-styled \"Nazi hunters.\" This determined and disparate group included a French husband and wife team, an American lawyer who served in the army on D-Day, a German prosecutor who had signed an oath to the Nazi Party, Israeli Mossad agents, and a death camp survivor. Over decades, these men and women scoured the world, tracking down the SS fugitives and bringing them to justice, which often meant death. Written in the fast-paced style of the Killing series, Killing the SS will educate and stun the reader.

He educated millions of readers about the origins of the universe and the nature of black holes, and inspired millions more by defying a terrifying early prognosis of ALS, which originally gave him only two years to live. In later life he could communicate only by using a few facial muscles, but he continued to advance his field and serve as a revered voice on social and humanitarian issues. Hawking not only unraveled some of the universe\u2019s greatest mysteries but also believed science plays a critical role in fixing problems here on Earth. Now, as we face immense challenges on our planet\u2014including climate change, the threat of nuclear war, and the development of artificial intelligence\u2014he turns his attention to the most urgent issues facing us. Will humanity survive? Should we colonize space?

Some even threw away the briefing books that had been prepared for them. Michael Lewis\u2019s brilliant narrative takes us into the engine rooms of a government under attack by its own leaders. In Agriculture the funding of vital programs like food stamps and school lunches is being slashed. The Commerce Department may not have enough staff to conduct the 2020 Census properly. Over at Energy, where international nuclear risk is managed, it\u2019s not clear there will be enough inspectors to track and locate black market uranium before terrorists do. Willful ignorance plays a role in these looming disasters. If your ambition is to maximize short-term gains without regard to the long-term cost, you are better off not knowing those costs. If you want to preserve your personal immunity to the hard problems, it\u2019s better never to really understand those problems. There is upside to ignorance, and downside to knowledge. Knowledge makes life messier. It makes it a bit more difficult for a person who wishes to shrink the world to a worldview. If there are dangerous fools in this book, there are also heroes, unsung, of course. They are the linchpins of the system\u2014those public servants whose knowledge, dedication, and proactivity keep the machinery running. Michael Lewis finds them, and he asks them what keeps them up at night."}, {"rank": 13, "rank_last_week": 10, "weeks_on_list": 17, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1501175513", "primary_isbn13": "9781501175510", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "description": "Based on hours of interviews with sources, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist describes debates and decision-making within the Trump White House.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Fear", "author": "Bob Woodward", "contributor": "by Bob Woodward", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781501175534.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Fear-Trump-White-Bob-Woodward-ebook/dp/B075RV48W3?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1501175513", "isbn13": "9781501175510"}, {"isbn10": "150117553X", "isbn13": "9781501175534"}, {"isbn10": "1508240094", "isbn13": "9781508240099"}, {"isbn10": "1432859684", "isbn13": "9781432859688"}, {"isbn10": "1501175521", "isbn13": "9781501175527"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Fear-Trump-White-Bob-Woodward-ebook/dp/B075RV48W3?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781501175510?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781501175510"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FFEAR%2FBob%2BWoodward%2F9781501175510"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781501175510"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781501175510?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/97f4a81a-dcd2-5bbf-9434-aecad71b44e4", "list_date": "2019/01/20", "published_data": "2018-09-11", "summary": "\u201cExplosive.\u201d\u2014The Washington Post \u201cDevastating.\u201d\u2014The New Yorker \u201cUnprecedented.\u201d\u2014CNN THE INSIDE STORY ON PRESIDENT TRUMP, AS ONLY BOB WOODWARD CAN TELL IT With authoritative reporting honed through eight presidencies from Nixon to Obama, author Bob Woodward reveals in unprecedented detail the harrowing life inside President Donald Trump\u2019s White House and precisely how he makes decisions on major foreign and domestic policies.

NAMED ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY THE WASHINGTON POST AND ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY The New York Times Book Review \u2022 Time \u2022 NPR \u2022 St. Louis Post-Dispatch Drawing on President Bush\u2019s personal diaries, on the diaries of his wife, Barbara, and on extraordinary access to the forty-first president and his family, Meacham paints an intimate and surprising portrait of an intensely private man who led the nation through tumultuous times. From the Oval Office to Camp David, from his study in the private quarters of the White House to Air Force One, from the fall of the Berlin Wall to the first Gulf War to the end of Communism, Destiny and Power charts the thoughts, decisions, and emotions of a modern president who may have been the last of his kind. This is the human story of a man who was, like the nation he led, at once noble and flawed. His was one of the great American lives. Born into a loving, privileged, and competitive family, Bush joined the navy on his eighteenth birthday and at age twenty was shot down on a combat mission over the Pacific. He married young, started a family, and resisted pressure to go to Wall Street, striking out for the adventurous world of Texas oil. Over the course of three decades, Bush would rise from the chairmanship of his county Republican Party to serve as congressman, ambassador to the United Nations, head of the Republican National Committee, envoy to China, director of Central Intelligence, vice president under Ronald Reagan, and, finally, president of the United States. In retirement he became the first president since John Adams to see his son win the ultimate prize in American politics. With access not only to the Bush diaries but, through extensive interviews, to the former president himself, Meacham presents Bush\u2019s candid assessments of many of the critical figures of the age, ranging from Richard Nixon to Nancy Reagan; Mao to Mikhail Gorbachev; Dick Cheney to Donald Rumsfeld; Henry Kissinger to Bill Clinton. Here is high politics as it really is but as we rarely see it. From the Pacific to the presidency, Destiny and Power charts the vicissitudes of the life of this quietly compelling American original.

Lewandowski and David N. Bossie, the authors of the blockbuster, Let Trump Be Trump: the Inside Story of His Rise to the Presidency, are back with their next New York Times bestseller. The assault on the 45th president began immediately following Donald J. Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential election. It was then that Democrats concocted the absurd story of Russian spies and international plots as an excuse for Hillary's humiliating defeat. It was in those early days, too, during the presidential transition, when enemies of Donald Trump began to tunnel their way into the White House with the intent to undermine the president and subvert his agenda. Perhaps there are no two people better to tell what is certain to be the story of our lifetime than Corey R. Lewandowski and David N. Bossie. The guys in the room who brought you the bestselling account of the 2016 Donald J. Trump for President campaign, Let Trump Be Trump, Lewandowski and Bossie now offer a first-hand account of what is, perhaps, the battle for the life of our very democracy. Using unparalleled, behind-the-scenes sourcing from inside the White House and on Capitol Hill, and access to the president and other key players, Trump's Enemies offers a never-before-seen look deep into the forces aligned against the president. Lewandowski and Bossie were present in Trump Tower and at Bedminster during the presidential transition and saw the events that gave root to the unelected \"resistance\" in the White House today. Bossie was witness to the moment the fake Russia investigation was enacted by James Comey, who legitimized the phony \"Steele dossier\" by presenting it to the new president-elect. A close confidant of the president, Lewandowski knows what goes on behind the West Wing walls as well as anyone. But Trump's Enemies is also the story of how President Trump is fighting back. In the face of a gale of media disinformation and the looming black cloud of Mueller's politically motivated investigation, President Trump has still managed to accomplish more than any of his predecessor in the short time he's been in office. Often traveling with the president on Air Force One to rallies around the country, Lewandowski and Bossie tell, as no one else can, the story of Donald Trump bringing his message to the people who are the only ones who should decide the future of his presidency-the American voters."}, {"rank": 7, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1101985267", "primary_isbn13": "9781101985267", "publisher": "Dutton", "description": "The founding member of the rock band Wilco discusses his life and artistic process.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Let'S Go (So We Can Get Back)", "author": "Jeff Tweedy", "contributor": "by Jeff Tweedy", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781101985267.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Lets-Can-Get-Back-Discording/dp/1101985267?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1101985267", "isbn13": "9781101985267"}, {"isbn10": "1101985283", "isbn13": "9781101985281"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Lets-Can-Get-Back-Discording/dp/1101985267?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781101985267?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781101985267"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FLET%2527S%2BGO%2B%2528SO%2BWE%2BCAN%2BGET%2BBACK%2529%2FJeff%2BTweedy%2F9781101985267"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781101985267"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781101985267?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/0ea3c50f-b13a-524b-a6a9-a6c9e0316a3b", "list_date": "2018/12/02", "published_data": "2018-11-13", "summary": "Wilco singer/songwriter Jeff Tweedy tells stories about his childhood in Belleville, Illinois; the St. Louis record store, rock clubs, and live-music circuit that sparked his songwriting and performing career; and the Chicago scene that brought it all together.

Looking back at this moment in history, historians will ask if Americans knew they were living through the first case of criminal conspiracy between an American presidential candidate turned commander in chief and a geopolitical enemy. The answer might be: it was hard to see the whole picture. The stories coming in from around the globe have often seemed fantastical: clandestine meetings in foreign capitals, secret recordings in a Moscow hotel, Kremlin agents infiltrating the Trump inner circle... Seth Abramson has tracked every one of these far-flung reports and now in, Proof of Collusion, he finally gives us a record of the unthinkable\u2014a president compromising American foreign policy in exchange for the promise of future business and covert election assistance. The attorney, professor, and former criminal investigator has used his exacting legal mind and forensic acumen to compile, organize, and analyze every piece of the Trump-Russia story. His conclusion is clear: the case for collusion is staring us in the face. Drawing from American and European news outlets, he takes readers through the Trump-Russia scandal chronologically, putting the developments in context and showing how they connect. His extraordinary march through all the public evidence includes: \u2014How Trump worked for thirty years to expand his real estate empire into Russia even as he was rescued from bankruptcy by Putin\u2019s oligarchs and Kremlin agents. \u2014How Russian intelligence gathered compromising material on him over multiple trips. \u2014How Trump recruited Russian allies and business partners while running for president. \u2014How he surrounded himself with advisers who engaged in clandestine negotiations with Russia. \u2014How Trump aides and family members held secret meetings with foreign agents and lied about them. By pulling every last thread of this complicated story together, Abramson argues that\u2014even in the absence of a Congressional investigation or a report from Special Counsel Mueller\u2014the public record already indicates a quid pro quo between Trump and the Kremlin. The most extraordinary part of the case for collusion is that so much of it unfolded in plain sight."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 3, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0062448307", "primary_isbn13": "9780062448309", "publisher": "Harper Design", "description": "A memoir by the actor and Grammy Award-winning singer and songwriter.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Hindsight", "author": "Justin Timberlake", "contributor": "by Justin Timberlake", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780062448309.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 405, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Hindsight-All-Things-Cant-Front/dp/0062448307?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0062448307", "isbn13": "9780062448309"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Hindsight-All-Things-Cant-Front/dp/0062448307?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780062448309?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780062448309"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FHINDSIGHT%2FJustin%2BTimberlake%2F9780062448309"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780062448309"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062448309?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/3bec2703-54e5-5dd3-b35b-b8d7dc9c71ce", "list_date": "2018/11/25", "published_data": "2018-10-30", "summary": "An Instant New York Times Bestseller \"I can't help that my music shows who I am in this moment, what I'm drawn to, what I'm wondering about.

He talks about his songwriting process, offering the back story to many of his hits.

Elaine Pagels looks to her own life to help address these questions. These questions took on a new urgency for Pagels when dealing with unimaginable loss\u2014the death of her young son, followed a year later by the shocking loss of her husband. Here she interweaves a personal story with the work that she loves, illuminating how, for better and worse, religious traditions have shaped how we understand ourselves; how we relate to one another; and, most importantly, how to get through the most difficult challenges we face. Drawing upon the perspectives of neurologists, anthropologists, and historians, as well as her own research, Pagels opens unexpected ways of understanding persistent religious aspects of our culture.

Despair and uncertainty surround us: in the news, in our families, and in ourselves. But even when life is at its bleakest--when we are, as she puts it, \"doomed, stunned, exhausted, and over-caffeinated\"--the seeds of rejuvenation are at hand. \"All truth is paradox,\" Lamott writes, \"and this turns out to be a reason for hope. If you arrive at a place in life that is miserable, it will change.\" That is the time when we must pledge not to give up but \"to do what Wendell Berry wrote: 'Be joyful, though you have considered all the facts.'\" In this profound and funny book, Lamott calls for each of us to rediscover the nuggets of hope and wisdom that are buried within us that can make life sweeter than we ever imagined. Divided into short chapters that explore life's essential truths, Almost Everything pinpoints these moments of insight as it shines an encouraging light forward.

When Abbi Jacobson announced to friends and acquaintances that she planned to drive across the country alone, she was met with lots of questions and opinions: Why wasn't she going with friends? Wouldn't it be incredibly lonely? The North route is better! Was it safe for a woman? The Southern route is the way to go! You should bring mace! And a common one... why? But Abbi had always found comfort in solitude, and needed space to step back and hit the reset button. As she spent time in each city and town on her way to Los Angeles, she mulled over the big questions-- What do I really want? What is the worst possible scenario in which I could run into my ex? How has the decision to wear my shirts tucked in been pivotal in my adulthood? In this collection of anecdotes, observations and reflections--all told in the sharp, wildly funny, and relatable voice that has endeared Abbi to critics and fans alike--readers will feel like they're in the passenger seat on a fun and, ultimately, inspiring journey.

Lukianoff and Haidt tell us that safetyism undermines the freedom of inquiry and speech that are indispensable to universities.\u201d \u2014Jonathan Marks, Commentary \u201cThe remedies the book outlines should be considered on college campuses, among parents of current and future students, and by anyone longing for a more sane society.\u201d \u2014Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Something has been going wrong on many college campuses in the last few years. Speakers are shouted down. Students and professors say they are walking on eggshells and are afraid to speak honestly. Rates of anxiety, depression, and suicide are rising\u2014on campus as well as nationally. How did this happen? First Amendment expert Greg Lukianoff and social psychologist Jonathan Haidt show how the new problems on campus have their origins in three terrible ideas that have become increasingly woven into American childhood and education: What doesn\u2019t kill you makes you weaker; always trust your feelings; and life is a battle between good people and evil people. These three Great Untruths contradict basic psychological principles about well-being and ancient wisdom from many cultures. Embracing these untruths\u2014and the resulting culture of safetyism\u2014interferes with young people\u2019s social, emotional, and intellectual development. It makes it harder for them to become autonomous adults who are able to navigate the bumpy road of life. Lukianoff and Haidt investigate the many social trends that have intersected to promote the spread of these untruths. They explore changes in childhood such as the rise of fearful parenting, the decline of unsupervised, child-directed play, and the new world of social media that has engulfed teenagers in the last decade. They examine changes on campus, including the corporatization of universities and the emergence of new ideas about identity and justice. They situate the conflicts on campus within the context of America\u2019s rapidly rising political polarization and dysfunction. This is a book for anyone who is confused by what is happening on college campuses today, or has children, or is concerned about the growing inability of Americans to live, work, and cooperate across party lines."}, {"rank": 8, "rank_last_week": 9, "weeks_on_list": 3, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0307409600", "primary_isbn13": "9780307409607", "publisher": "Crown", "description": "How American presidents waged wars and expanded the power of the executive branch.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Presidents Of War", "author": "Michael Beschloss", "contributor": "by Michael Beschloss", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780307409607.jpg", "book_image_width": 326, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Presidents-War-Michael-Beschloss/dp/0307409600?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/books/review/michael-beschloss-presidents-of-war.html", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0307409600", "isbn13": "9780307409607"}, {"isbn10": "0804137013", "isbn13": "9780804137010"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Presidents-War-Michael-Beschloss/dp/0307409600?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780307409607?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780307409607"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FPRESIDENTS%2BOF%2BWAR%2FMichael%2BBeschloss%2F9780307409607"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780307409607"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780307409607?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/2d44e635-89ac-5300-bb85-46f2380256a4", "list_date": "2018/11/11", "published_data": "2018-10-09", "summary": "From a preeminent presidential historian comes a groundbreaking and often surprising saga of America's wartime chief executives Ten years in the research and writing, Presidents of War is a fresh, magisterial, intimate look at a procession of American leaders as they took the nation into conflict and mobilized their country for victory. It brings us into the room as they make the most difficult decisions that face any President, at times sending hundreds of thousands of American men and women to their deaths. From James Madison and the War of 1812 to recent times, we see them struggling with Congress, the courts, the press, their own advisors and antiwar protesters; seeking comfort from their spouses, families and friends; and dropping to their knees in prayer. We come to understand how these Presidents were able to withstand the pressures of war--both physically and emotionally--or were broken by them. Beschloss's interviews with surviving participants in the drama and his findings in original letters, diaries, once-classified national security documents, and other sources help him to tell this story in a way it has not been told before. Presidents of War combines the sense of being there with the overarching context of two centuries of American history. This important book shows how far we have traveled from the time of our Founders, who tried to constrain presidential power, to our modern day, when a single leader has the potential to launch nuclear weapons that can destroy much of the human race."}, {"rank": 5, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1501184717", "primary_isbn13": "9781501184710", "publisher": "Touchstone", "description": "A memoir by the actress and host of the late-night talk show \u201cBusy Tonight.\u201d", "price": "0.00", "title": "This Will Only Hurt A Little", "author": "Busy Philipps", "contributor": "by Busy Philipps", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781501184710.jpg", "book_image_width": 323, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/This-Will-Only-Hurt-Little/dp/1501184717?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1501184717", "isbn13": "9781501184710"}, {"isbn10": "1501184733", "isbn13": "9781501184734"}, {"isbn10": "1508268827", "isbn13": "9781508268826"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/This-Will-Only-Hurt-Little/dp/1501184717?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781501184710?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781501184710"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHIS%2BWILL%2BONLY%2BHURT%2BA%2BLITTLE%2FBusy%2BPhilipps%2F9781501184710"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781501184710"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781501184710?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/e875c121-34c7-5a47-a42a-ef8b14f25e02", "list_date": "2018/11/04", "published_data": "2018-10-16", "summary": "INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER A hilarious, heartfelt, and refreshingly honest memoir by the beloved comedic actress known for her roles on Freaks and Geeks, Dawson\u2019s Creek, and Cougar Town who has become \u201cthe breakout star of Instagram stories...Imagine I Love Lucy mixed with a modern lifestyle guru\u201d (The New Yorker). \u201cYou guys!!

On the page, Philipps\u2019 toughness shines through\u2014a rare and feminine ethical code; devoted and blunt. It\u2019s a thrill to watch her stumble right up until the very moment she storms the f*cking gates.\u201d \u2014Miranda July There\u2019s no stopping Busy Philipps. From the time she was two and \u201caced out in her nudes\u201d to explore the neighborhood (as her mom famously described her toddler jailbreak), Busy has always been headstrong, defiant, and determined not to miss out on all the fun. These qualities led her to leave Scottsdale, Arizona, at the age of nineteen to pursue her passion for acting in Hollywood. But much like her painful and painfully funny teenage years, chasing her dreams wasn\u2019t always easy and sometimes hurt more than a little. In this stunningly candid memoir, Busy opens up about chafing against a sexist system rife with on-set bullying and body shaming, being there when friends face shattering loss, enduring devastating personal and professional betrayals from those she loved best, and struggling with postpartum anxiety and the challenges of motherhood. But Busy also brings to the page her sly sense of humor and the unshakeable sense that disappointment shouldn\u2019t stand in her way\u2014even when she\u2019s knocked down both figuratively and literally (from a knee injury at her seventh-grade dance to a violent encounter on the set of Freaks and Geeks). The rough patches in her life are tempered by times of hilarity and joy: leveraging a flawless impression of Cher from Clueless into her first paid acting gig, helping reinvent a genre with cult classic Freaks and Geeks, becoming fast friends with Dawson\u2019s Creek castmate Michelle Williams, staging her own surprise wedding, conquering natural childbirth with the help of a Mad Men\u2013themed hallucination, and more. Busy is the rare entertainer whose impressive arsenal of talents as an actress is equally matched by her storytelling ability, sense of humor, and sharp observations about life, love, and motherhood. Her conversational writing reminds us what we love about her on screens large and small.

He succeeds, marvelously.\"--The New York Times Book Review The thrilling story of the year that won the Revolutionary War from the New York Times bestselling author of In the Heart of the Sea and Mayflower. In the concluding volume of his acclaimed American Revolution series, Nathaniel Philbrick tells the thrilling story of the year that won the Revolutionary War. In the fall of 1780, after five frustrating years of war, George Washington had come to realize that the only way to defeat the British Empire was with the help of the French navy. But coordinating his army's movements with those of a fleet of warships based thousands of miles away was next to impossible. And then, on September 5, 1781, the impossible happened. Recognized today as one of the most important naval engagements in the history of the world, the Battle of the Chesapeake\u2014fought without a single American ship\u2014made the subsequent victory of the Americans at Yorktown a virtual inevitability. A riveting and wide-ranging story, full of dramatic, unexpected turns, In the Hurricane's Eye reveals that the fate of the American Revolution depended, in the end, on Washington and the sea."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "0785221603", "primary_isbn13": "9780785221609", "publisher": "Thomas Nelson", "description": "A memoir by the professional stock car racing driver and television sports analyst.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Racing To The Finish", "author": "Dale Earnhardt Jr with Ryan McGee", "contributor": "by Dale Earnhardt Jr. with Ryan McGee", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9780785221609.jpg", "book_image_width": 330, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Racing-Finish-Dale-Earnhardt-Jr/dp/0785221603?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "0785221603", "isbn13": "9780785221609"}, {"isbn10": "0785221964", "isbn13": "9780785221968"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Racing-Finish-Dale-Earnhardt-Jr/dp/0785221603?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9780785221609?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9780785221609"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FRACING%2BTO%2BTHE%2BFINISH%2FDale%2BEarnhardt%2BJr%2Bwith%2BRyan%2BMcGee%2F9780785221609"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9780785221609"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780785221609?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/97b22648-38a7-526f-862d-5a238a423cc3", "list_date": "2018/11/04", "published_data": "2018", "summary": "Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s only authorized book revealing the inside track on his final year of racing and retirement from the driver's seat. \"Time was running out on my charade... My secrets were about to be exposed to the world.\" It was a seemingly minor crash at Michigan International Speedway in June 2016 that ended the day early for Dale Earnhardt Jr. What he didn't know was that it would also end his driving for the year. He'd dealt with concussions before, but concussions are like snowflakes, no two are the same. And recovery can be brutal, and lengthy. When NASCAR star Dale Earnhardt Jr. retired from professional stock car racing in 2017, he walked away from his career as a healthy man. But for years, he had worried that the worsening effects of multiple racing-related concussions would end not only his time on the track but his ability to live a full and happy life. Torn between a race-at-all-costs culture and the fear that something was terribly wrong, Earnhardt tried to pretend that everything was fine, but the private notes about his escalating symptoms that he kept on his phone reveal a vicious cycle: suffering injuries on Sunday, struggling through the week, then recovering in time to race again the following weekend. For the first time, he shares these notes and fully reveals the physical and emotional struggles he faced as he fought to close out his career on his own terms. In this candid reflection, Earnhardt opens up about his frustration with the slow recovery, his admiration for the woman who stood by him through it all, and his determination to share his own experience so that others don't have to suffer in silence. Steering his way to the final checkered flag of his storied career proved to be the most challenging race and most rewarding finish of his life."}, {"rank": 10, "rank_last_week": 10, "weeks_on_list": 2, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1524762849", "primary_isbn13": "9781524762841", "publisher": "Currency", "description": "A memoir by the founder of the nonprofit Charity: Water.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Thirst", "author": "Scott Harrison with Lisa Sweetingham", "contributor": "by Scott Harrison with Lisa Sweetingham", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781524762841.jpg", "book_image_width": 326, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Thirst-Story-Redemption-Compassion-Mission/dp/1524762849?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1524762849", "isbn13": "9781524762841"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Thirst-Story-Redemption-Compassion-Mission/dp/1524762849?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781524762841?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781524762841"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FTHIRST%2FScott%2BHarrison%2Bwith%2BLisa%2BSweetingham%2F9781524762841"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781524762841"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781524762841?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/b1cb7424-d65d-572d-9adf-3a48cbd5b8b3", "list_date": "2018/10/28", "published_data": "2018-10-02", "summary": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 An inspiring personal story of redemption, second chances, and the transformative power within us all, from the founder and CEO of the nonprofit charity: water.

But 10 years in, desperately unhappy and morally bankrupt, he asked himself, \"What would the exact opposite of my life look like?\" Walking away from everything, Harrison spent the next 16 months on a hospital ship in West Africa and discovered his true calling. In 2006, with no money and less than no experience, Harrison founded charity: water. Today, his organization has raised over $400 million to bring clean drinking water to more than 10 million people around the globe. In Thirst, Harrison recounts the twists and turns that built charity: water into one of the most trusted and admired nonprofits in the world.

Her wise and provocative columns helped make sense of a cultural transformation.\u201d\u2014National Magazine Award Citation, 2018 \u201cThe most brilliant voice on feminism in this country.\u201d\u2014Anne Lamott, author of Bird by Bird From Rebecca Traister, the New York Times bestselling author of All the Single Ladies comes a vital, incisive exploration into the transformative power of female anger and its ability to transcend into a political movement. In the year 2018, it seems as if women\u2019s anger has suddenly erupted into the public conversation. But long before Pantsuit Nation, before the Women\u2019s March, and before the #MeToo movement, women\u2019s anger was not only politically catalytic\u2014but politically problematic. The story of female fury and its cultural significance demonstrates the long history of bitter resentment that has enshrouded women\u2019s slow rise to political power in America, as well as the ways that anger is received when it comes from women as opposed to when it comes from men. With eloquence and fervor, Rebecca tracks the history of female anger as political fuel\u2014from suffragettes marching on the White House to office workers vacating their buildings after Clarence Thomas was confirmed to the Supreme Court. Here Traister explores women\u2019s anger at both men and other women; anger between ideological allies and foes; the varied ways anger is perceived based on its owner; as well as the history of caricaturing and delegitimizing female anger; and the way women\u2019s collective fury has become transformative political fuel\u2014as is most certainly occurring today. She deconstructs society\u2019s (and the media\u2019s) condemnation of female emotion (notably, rage) and the impact of their resulting repercussions. Highlighting a double standard perpetuated against women by all sexes, and its disastrous, stultifying effect, Traister\u2019s latest is timely and crucial. It offers a glimpse into the galvanizing force of women\u2019s collective anger, which, when harnessed, can change history."}, {"rank": 14, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 1, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "154608293X", "primary_isbn13": "9781546082934", "publisher": "Center Street", "description": "The conservative commentator uses the Salem Witch Trials and the Red Scares of the early 20th century to contextualize criticisms of President Trump.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Stop Mass Hysteria", "author": "Michael Savage", "contributor": "by Michael Savage", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781546082934.jpg", "book_image_width": 329, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Stop-Mass-Hysteria-Americas-Insanity/dp/154608293X?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "154608293X", "isbn13": "9781546082934"}, {"isbn10": "1546082905", "isbn13": "9781546082903"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Stop-Mass-Hysteria-Americas-Insanity/dp/154608293X?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781546082934?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781546082934"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FSTOP%2BMASS%2BHYSTERIA%2FMichael%2BSavage%2F9781546082934"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781546082934"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781546082934?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/d2784d23-2275-5431-9b4d-b59f9e0876f1", "list_date": "2018/10/28", "published_data": "2018-10-09", "summary": "The New York Times Bestseller! #1 NYT bestselling author Michael Savage calls out the mass hysteria mongers and their methods, and shows Americans that we must look to history to understand the present and avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. Since Donald Trump's historic ascendance to the presidency, American politics have reached a boiling point. Social and economic issues, even national security, have become loud, violent flashpoints for political rivals in the government, in the media and on the streets. This collective derangement has a name: mass hysteria. In his new book, Stop Mass Hysteria, #1 New York Times bestselling author Michael Savage not only deconstructs the Left's unhinged response to traditional American values like borders, language, and culture, but takes the reader on an unprecedented journey through mass hysteria's long history in the United States. From Christopher Columbus to the Salem Witch trials to the so-called \"Red Scares\" of the 1930s and 40s and much more, Dr. Savage recounts the many times collective insanity has gripped the American public - often prompted by sinister politicians with ulterior motives. Dr. Savage provides vital context for the common elements of dozens of outbreaks of mass hysteria in the past, their causes, their short and long-term effects, and the tactics of the puppet masters who duped gullible masses into fearing threats both real and imagined. By shining a light on the true nature and causes of American mass hysteria in the past, Savage provides an insightful look into who and what is causing dangerous unrest in our lives - and why."}, {"rank": 15, "rank_last_week": 0, "weeks_on_list": 9, "asterisk": 0, "dagger": 0, "primary_isbn10": "1546083421", "primary_isbn13": "9781546083429", "publisher": "Center Street", "description": "The legal analyst and Fox News host argues in favor of President Trump.", "price": "0.00", "title": "Liars, Leakers And Liberals", "author": "Jeanine Pirro", "contributor": "by Jeanine Pirro", "contributor_note": "", "book_image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/du-prd/books/images/9781546083429.jpg", "book_image_width": 328, "book_image_height": 495, "amazon_product_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Liars-Leakers-Liberals-Anti-Trump-Conspiracy/dp/1546083421?tag=NYTBSREV-20", "age_group": "", "book_review_link": "", "first_chapter_link": "", "sunday_review_link": "", "article_chapter_link": "", "isbns": [{"isbn10": "1546083421", "isbn13": "9781546083429"}, {"isbn10": "1546083413", "isbn13": "9781546083412"}, {"isbn10": "1549112732", "isbn13": "9781549112737"}, {"isbn10": "1549143506", "isbn13": "9781549143502"}, {"isbn10": "1546082956", "isbn13": "9781546082958"}], "buy_links": [{"name": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Liars-Leakers-Liberals-Anti-Trump-Conspiracy/dp/1546083421?tag=NYTBSREV-20"}, {"name": "Apple Books", "url": "https://goto.applebooks.apple/9781546083429?at=10lIEQ"}, {"name": "Barnes and Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-11819508?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2F%3Fean%3D9781546083429"}, {"name": "Books-A-Million", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7990613-35140?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fp%2FLIARS%252C%2BLEAKERS%2BAND%2BLIBERALS%2FJeanine%2BPirro%2F9781546083429"}, {"name": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/3546/9781546083429"}, {"name": "IndieBound", "url": "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781546083429?aff=NYT"}], "book_uri": "nyt://book/f2a5d566-707b-50a7-9291-fb3ef63c10b2", "list_date": "2018/10/28", "published_data": "2018-07-17", "summary": "Get the story the Fake News media doesn't want you to hear in the #1 New York Times bestseller: a withering indictment of the Deep State plot against Trump and a firsthand account of the real presidency, based on interviews with the Trump family and top administration officials.

But there are dark forces that seek to obstruct and undermine the president and reverse the results of the 2016 presidential election. They are part of a wide-ranging conspiracy that would seem incredible if it weren't being perpetrated openly. Driven by ambition, blinded by greed, and bound by a common goal -- to unseat the 45th President of the United States -- this cabal is determined to maintain its wrongful hold on national political power. Fox News host Jeanine Pirro uncovers the elements of this conspiracy, including: \"Fake news\" propaganda, Law enforcement corruption at the highest levels, National security leaks by the intelligence community, Bureaucratic resistance to lawful and constitutional executive orders issued by the duly elected president, Crooked deals with foreign governments by U.S. officials sworn to defend our Constitution. It's about time the American public knows the truth about the plot to bring down the Trump presidency. By the time you've finished this book, you'll agree with Judge Pirro that the only way to stop these hoodlums is to Take Them Out in Cuffs!"}]
